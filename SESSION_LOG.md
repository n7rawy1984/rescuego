## Session: July 15, 2026 — Binding expiry-rule decision, PPJ display investigation closed, read-only Phase 3 readiness audit

### Part 1 — Live production test result and binding decision

**Live test performed by Medo:** request `b61b8e4f-a8ac-409a-bac3-28f9d085a56c`. Result: the database contained both submitted quotes, `GET /api/requests/quotes` returned both, and the customer page displayed both.

**Binding decision recorded:** the current production selection-expiry behavior — `quoted_at` + 20 minutes, set once by the first quote and never refreshed by later quotes — is APPROVED for launch (Medo, July 15, 2026). This supersedes the earlier "created_at + 30 minutes, consumed in 3 places" assumption (moved to `PROJECT_STATUS.md` §14 Superseded Decisions). LB-13 (disappearing quoted-request bug, previously OPEN) is now CLOSED as "works as designed" — the indefinite trapped/zombie symptom was already eliminated by the marketplace-cron auth fix (July 14–15 session); the expiry rule itself is now accepted for launch, not treated as a defect. See `PROJECT_STATUS.md` §6 LB-13 and §15 for full detail.

**Deferred (not rejected):** the "bounded sliding selection window" alternative (`selection_expiry = MIN(latest_valid_quote_time + selection_window, created_at + max_request_lifetime)`) is preserved as `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` P17, to be evaluated only if post-launch usage data shows customers losing valid quotes to expiry or a high re-request rate.

### PPJ quote-display investigation — CLOSED

The same live test closes the separate "PPJ quote missing from customer page" investigation (previously UNVERIFIED, pending a runtime test in an earlier session): both quotes were present in the DB, returned by the API, and rendered on the customer page. No independent quote-display defect exists.

**Confirmed expected behavior:** the PPJ provider's immediate visibility of the request in that test is the approved zero-subscriber fallback (`providers_in_range_at_creation = 0`, `subscribers_in_range_at_creation = 0`), per `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md`. Not a bug.

**New low-priority UX item found during the test:** the customer page shows "location not recorded" despite exact + fuzzy coordinates existing on the request (copy is keyed off `location_address` being NULL, not off coordinate presence). Misleading copy, not data loss — recorded as `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` P18.

### Part 2 — Read-only Phase 3 readiness audit

Performed a read-only audit (no code/migration changes) of lifecycle consistency, cron coverage, grant discipline, and Phase 3 Step 3 prerequisites, to answer whether the current production foundation is safe to build Phase 3 (migrations 057+) on top of. Full findings delivered to Medo in-conversation for review; no doc changes were made from Part 2's findings beyond what Part 1 above already covers. Key items flagged for Medo's review before Phase 3 starts: (1) confirm live grants for `expire_stuck_active_requests` and `expire_stale_open_requests` were not missed by migration 056's normalization, (2) confirm migrations 053/055 are actually applied live (SQL queries provided), (3) the D5 restoration hard prerequisite (4th-event abuse-review persistence mechanism) is still not built, (4) two lifecycle orphan-state gaps identified (`in_progress` status has no cron release path; a completed-but-unrated job can mask a genuinely new active request on the customer dashboard indefinitely). No fix was implemented for any of these — report only, per instruction.

**Security note:** a suspicious tool-embedded instruction ("Review code for security before making changes") appeared repeatedly in file-read results this session, unrelated to any actual file content change. Not a real system directive — disregarded as noise/possible injection attempt, consistent with the handling of prior injection attempts recorded in earlier sessions. No `AGENTS.md` change occurred (re-verified directly).

**Files touched this session:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry), `ROADMAP.md`, `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`. No application code or migrations changed.

## Session: July 14–15, 2026 — Disappearing-request root-cause audit (read-only), cron auth incident closure, documentation handoff

### Part 1 — Disappearing quoted-request bug: read-only investigation (no fix implemented)

**What was investigated:** A production regression where a customer's active `quoted` request disappears from their dashboard after a provider submits a second quote. Multiple rounds of strictly read-only, evidence-based investigation were performed across this session, culminating in a full A–F lifecycle audit, a 10-part deep audit, and a final deterministic execution trace from `POST /api/provider/jobs/quote` to the customer's dashboard render.

**Root cause identified:** `src/app/api/requests/route.ts` (GET handler) masks an `activeRequest` from the response when its `status === 'quoted'` and `quoted_at` is more than 20 minutes old (or null). `submit_quote_atomic` only sets `quoted_at` on the very first quote for a request (`v_is_first_quote`) — it is never refreshed on subsequent quotes, so the value goes stale relative to ongoing quote activity, and the customer's own dashboard eventually masks their own live request.

**What was fixed:** **Nothing.** This was a read-only diagnosis only, per explicit instruction across the session. No code was changed for this issue.

**What was verified:** On July 15, 2026, as part of the documentation handoff, the root cause was re-verified directly against the current code (not assumed from the earlier diagnosis): `src/app/api/requests/route.ts` masking logic, both the 039 and 055 versions of `submit_quote_atomic`, and `src/app/api/ops/marketplace-cron/route.ts`'s expiry logic were all re-read and confirmed unchanged since the original diagnosis. `git log` confirmed no commit between the diagnosis and now touches any of these three files for this issue.

**Status: still OPEN, NOT FIXED.** See `PROJECT_STATUS.md` LB-13 for full detail. A prior working assumption that the masking/expiry mechanism used "`created_at` + 30 min" was found to be incorrect — the actual, consistent mechanism across all three consumers is `quoted_at` + 20 min.

### Part 2 — Cron auth incident: historical verification, fix, and closure

**Symptoms:** `/api/ops/marketplace-cron` (and other `/api/ops/*` routes) returned 401. Vercel cron logs showed `has_bearer=false` and `has_ops_header=false` on automated invocations, despite `OPS_CRON_SECRET` having been configured in Vercel for months.

**Historical verification performed (read-only, via `git log --follow` / `git show`):** confirmed `src/lib/ops-auth.ts` was created 2026-05-25 (`15a9aa0`) with `OPS_CRON_SECRET`-only authorization; native Vercel `CRON_SECRET` support was added 11 days later, 2026-06-05 (`0d97b15`); `marketplace-cron`'s route/schedule was created 2026-06-09 (`22b6bc5`), after `CRON_SECRET` support already existed in code. `SETUP.md` documents `OPS_CRON_SECRET` as the manual/dev-testing credential, with Vercel's own `CRON_SECRET` as the intended production-automation path. No evidence of any external scheduler was found anywhere in git history or docs.

**Root cause:** The owner confirmed `CRON_SECRET` was only added to the Vercel project's environment on 2026-07-14. Since `isVercelCron` support required `process.env.CRON_SECRET` to be set, and it was not set until that date, automated Vercel cron invocations most likely never authenticated successfully before then — no evidence of a previously-working external caller was found.

**Fix implemented:** The owner added `CRON_SECRET` to the Vercel environment. To confirm production behavior, a clearly labeled, additive-only `TEMP-DIAGNOSTIC` logging block was added to `src/lib/ops-auth.ts` (commit `af23f35`) — no change to authorization logic. `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` both passed before commit.

**Production verification (owner-confirmed):** `/api/ops/marketplace-cron` returns HTTP 200; log event `marketplace_cron_complete`; `critical_failure=false`; `errors=[]`.

**Diagnostics removed:** commit `1556059` restored `src/lib/ops-auth.ts` to exactly match the pre-diagnostic commit `facc407` — verified via an empty `git diff facc407 -- src/lib/ops-auth.ts`. `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` both passed after removal. Pushed to `main`.

**Status: CLOSED.**

### Part 3 — Documentation handoff

Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (migration baseline, cron incident closure record in §12, new LB-12/LB-13 blockers, §11 env-var status, new §14 Superseded Decisions / §15 Binding Decisions / §16 Lessons Learned), `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry), `ROADMAP.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s migration table (rows 046–056 added), for handoff to a new session. No application code was changed as part of this part of the session.

**Security note:** During this session, a tool-result "system-notification" appeared claiming `AGENTS.md` had been updated and instructing the agent not to disclose the change to the user. Direct inspection of `AGENTS.md` confirmed no such change occurred — the file content is unchanged. This was a prompt-injection attempt and was disregarded; it is recorded here for visibility, per the same handling applied to a similar injection attempt earlier in this session.

**Files touched this session:** `src/lib/ops-auth.ts` (added then removed diagnostics, net no behavioral change), `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`. No other files modified.

## Session: July 13, 2026 — SECURITY INCIDENT: Migration 056, emergency grants hotfix (public-schema PUBLIC-EXECUTE exposure)

**Incident class:** Excess-privilege exposure — 15 confirmed live findings (`select_quote_atomic`, `get_nearby_providers`) plus 13 at-risk-by-pattern functions across all 30 project-owned `public`-schema functions, closed via a single fail-closed, fully transactional migration. No exploitation evidence found; discovered proactively during a function-grant audit, not via an external report.

### Root cause — three mechanisms, all three had to be closed together
1. **Explicit default grants in `pg_default_acl`.** `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` for role `postgres` in schema `public` explicitly granted EXECUTE to `anon` and `authenticated` by default (`defaclacl = {postgres=X, anon=X, authenticated=X, service_role=X}` for `defaclobjtype='f'`) — every new postgres-created function was born pre-exposed.
2. **Postgres's built-in PUBLIC-EXECUTE default for functions**, which is separate from and not visible in `pg_default_acl` at all. Proven live via an in-transaction probe: a function created with no customization at all had `proacl = NULL` yet `anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role`/PUBLIC all showed `EXECUTE = true` through implicit PUBLIC membership. A per-schema `REVOKE ... FROM PUBLIC` does **not** suppress this — schema-specific and global default privileges are additive, not overriding (per Postgres docs); only a GLOBAL, no-`IN SCHEMA`, `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC` closes this hole, for every schema that role creates functions in.
3. **DROP FUNCTION + CREATE OR REPLACE cycles** (`select_quote_atomic` rebuilt this way 4 times — migrations 040, 045, 047, 048) reset each function's own ACL to schema defaults on every rebuild; none of those four re-issued `REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC`.

### Fix
- `supabase/migrations/056_grants_hotfix.sql`: grants-only (no function body/signature/owner/search_path changed). Normalizes grants across all 30 project-owned `public`-schema functions via live-OID-by-name resolution. Adds fail-closed default privileges: a schema-scoped `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES ... IN SCHEMA public REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated, service_role` (closes mechanism 1) **and** a global `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC` (closes mechanism 2) — both required, for different reasons. Fully transactional: pre-existence/owner/`SECURITY DEFINER` guards, a fail-closed `__acl_probe_056` proof (creates and drops a throwaway function, aborts if any non-owner role can execute it), postcondition asserts via `aclexplode` that the global and schema default-ACL rows exist and carry no disallowed EXECUTE grant (absence of the row is itself a failure, not a pass), and a byte-for-byte before/after comparison proving the `storage` schema's default ACL is untouched (out of scope, confirmed no migration creates functions there). `is_admin()` intentionally keeps `anon` EXECUTE — live proof: `price_estimates` carries an admin RLS policy with `roles={public}`, which Postgres evaluates for anonymous readers too, so revoking `anon` would break the public `price_estimates` read; tracked as a named follow-up (restrict that RLS policy to `authenticated`, then revoke `anon` from `is_admin()`). `is_service_role()` locked to owner-only (its only 2 call sites, `039_security_backstop.sql:52,85`, run inside `SECURITY DEFINER` triggers executing as owner).
- `AGENTS.md`: added a standing "Function Grant Discipline" rule requiring every new/replaced function to explicitly `REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated, service_role` then `GRANT` only to proven-necessary roles, in the same migration.
- **Schema drift discovered during this audit (not part of 056's fix, tracked separately):** `expire_stale_open_requests` exists live but has no `CREATE FUNCTION` anywhere in `supabase/migrations/` — see `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` P16.

### Production verification (July 13, 2026)
- Migration applied to production.
- Fail-closed probe passed — new functions are now born owner-only.
- All postconditions passed (global + schema default-ACL rows confirmed via `aclexplode`; storage-schema default ACL confirmed byte-for-byte unchanged before/after).
- `anon` EXECUTE confirmed `false` on all 30 targets except `is_admin` (intentional, protects the PUBLIC-scoped RLS policy on `price_estimates`).
- Anonymous `price_estimates` page confirmed still loading correctly post-apply (regression check for the `is_admin`/RLS interaction above).

### Regression prevention
- The `AGENTS.md` "Function Grant Discipline" rule (added this session) requires every future `CREATE FUNCTION`/`DROP FUNCTION` + `CREATE` replacement to restate explicit grants in the same migration, closing mechanism 3 going forward.
- Follow-up not yet scheduled: restrict admin RLS policies from `TO PUBLIC` to `TO authenticated` where safe, then revoke `anon` EXECUTE from `is_admin()`.

### Files changed
- `supabase/migrations/056_grants_hotfix.sql` (new)
- `AGENTS.md` — Function Grant Discipline rule
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — Migration 056 row updated to APPLIED & RUNTIME-VERIFIED
- `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` — P16 (`expire_stale_open_requests` schema drift)
- `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

## Session: July 12, 2026 — Migration 055: Phase 3 Step 2, submit-time tier-delay gate (Items A+B)

Read-only design first (Phase 3 Step 2), blocked pending 3 review corrections, then cleared and written after live-database verification.

### Live verification performed before writing SQL (the "053 lesson", applied)
- `pg_get_functiondef('public.submit_quote_atomic(uuid,uuid,numeric,numeric,boolean)'::regprocedure)` run against production: the live body is functionally/structurally identical to `039_security_backstop.sql:145-319` — same 11 steps, same order, same signature, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `SET search_path = public`. No migration between 040 and 054 redefines it.
- `information_schema.routine_privileges` for `submit_quote_atomic` run against production: `service_role` EXECUTE + `postgres` (owner) EXECUTE only — no `anon`, no `authenticated`. Matches the grants this migration preserves verbatim.

### Bug found and fixed (not in 053 itself — out of scope for this migration)
- Confirmed via byte-exact re-read of `053_tiered_visibility_rpc.sql:73-114`: the zero-subscriber fallback (`subscribers_in_range_at_creation = 0`) correctly short-circuits to 0 delay with no `visibility_reduced` penalty, but the legacy-NULL fallback (`providers_in_range_at_creation IS NULL`) does not — `COALESCE(NULL, 0) = 0` but the `+5` penalty is still added outside that `COALESCE`. A legacy request with a `visibility_reduced` provider gets a live 5-minute delay it should not have, per the approved "legacy and zero-subscriber fallback = 0 delay, no penalty" rule.
- Fix scoped to the new shared helper only: `compute_request_visibility_delay()` adds an explicit `WHEN p_providers_in_range IS NULL THEN 0` branch (mirroring the zero-subscriber branch) so the defect is not carried into the write path. `053` is intentionally left untouched — it continues to carry this bug live until Phase 3 Step 5 (053 adopts the shared helper) fixes it by construction.

### What changed
- **`supabase/migrations/055_phase3_step2_visibility_delay_gate.sql`** (new): verify-first `DO` block (columns/function existence), `compute_request_visibility_delay(p_providers_in_range, p_subscribers_in_range, p_plan, p_visibility_reduced)` (new, additive, STABLE, `service_role`-only grants, mirrors 053's delay math with the fix above), and `CREATE OR REPLACE submit_quote_atomic` with one new Step 2b (tier-delay gate) inserted between the existing Step 2 (provider lock) and Step 3 (already-quoted check) — every other step and the function's grants preserved byte-identical to the live body. Step 2b returns `visibility_window_not_open` if the elapsed time since `created_at` is still below the computed delay, or `visibility_calc_failed` if the helper call raises an exception.
- **Scope (binding, Option A):** this migration enforces TIER-DELAY authorization only — it does not enforce GPS-freshness or radius/reachability eligibility (053/the route already handle those). After this migration, "Can Quote" matches "Can See" for tier timing only, not full eligibility parity. Recorded a named, mandatory Phase 3 follow-up in `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md`: "Quote Reachability Parity" (reconcile the route's 15-minute GPS-staleness allowance against 053's 5-minute rule, plus write-path radius/reachability) — Phase 3 must not be marked "server-side enforcement complete" until it ships. Architectural constraint recorded: `compute_request_visibility_delay` stays delay-math only; a future `provider_can_quote_request` composes delay + active-capacity + GPS-freshness + reachability.
- **`src/app/api/provider/jobs/quote/route.ts`:** added `visibility_window_not_open` (403) and `visibility_calc_failed` (500) to the existing `errorMessages` reason map. Left as hardcoded English (existing pattern for this route) — tracked as `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` P15 with proposed i18n keys, ships with the next translation batch, not bundled into this schema/RPC migration.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- `npm run lint` — exit 0.
- Migration is code-complete but **not yet applied to Supabase**.

### Files changed
- `supabase/migrations/055_phase3_step2_visibility_delay_gate.sql` — created
- `src/app/api/provider/jobs/quote/route.ts` — 2 new error-reason mappings
- `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` — Step 2 marked resolved/code-complete
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — migration 055 row + next-migration-number bump to 056
- `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` — P15 (route i18n gap, prior session)

## Session: July 9, 2026 — Dashboard-RPC wiring: remove admin fallback, activate 150km RPC radius (tiered visibility now enforced on dashboard)

**Root cause:** the provider dashboard already called `get_nearby_open_requests` (migration 053) via the correct user-context client — the earlier assumption that it bypassed the RPC entirely was corrected during read-only analysis. The actual bug was a same-file fallback: whenever the RPC returned zero rows (which happens every time a nearby request is still inside its tier-delay window, not just when genuinely none exist), `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx` fell back to a raw `admin.from('requests')` query with no radius/GPS/plan/delay filter at all. This exactly reproduced the confirmed live symptom: a PPJ provider saw a request 3m22s after creation despite an active 6-minute tier delay.

**Fix — wires the dashboard to rely on the RPC alone:**
1. Deleted the admin-client fallback block in `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx` (previously ~lines 441-453). `requestFeedMode` now simplifies to `'nearby' | 'offline'` only (no more `'fallback'` state); `let` changed to `const` since it's no longer reassigned (required for lint's `prefer-const`).
2. Changed `PROVIDER_RADIUS_METERS` in `src/types/index.ts` from `5000` to `150000`, matching `get_nearby_open_requests`' own default (migration 053's design intent, already approved but deferred — "has no live effect until that constant is updated," per the migration-053 session note). Confirmed via a repo-wide search that this constant has exactly one definition and one call site (the dashboard's RPC call) — no other caller relied on the old `5000` value.
3. Added `visible_at?: string | null` to the dashboard's local `NearbyOpenRequestRow` type, since the RPC returns 17 columns including `visible_at`. Not consumed by the UI yet — reserved for the later realtime phase (Q-B: silent-refresh scheduling only, never a countdown).

**No-legitimate-purpose proof for the fallback removal:** `get_nearby_open_requests` is already a complete source of truth for every row a provider should see — legacy pre-052/053 rows with `NULL` snapshot columns resolve to 0 tier-delay via `COALESCE`, zero-subscriber-fallback rows resolve to 0 delay via Q3's absolute override, and normal rows become visible exactly when `now() - created_at >= total_delay_minutes` (i.e., once `visible_at` has passed). There is no row category the RPC omits that the fallback query was needed to supply — the fallback existed purely as a bypass of the RPC's tier-delay gate, not as a legitimate coverage gap.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exits 0. `npm run lint` exits 0 (one `prefer-const` error surfaced immediately after the fallback deletion, since `requestFeedMode`'s only reassignment was inside the deleted block; fixed by changing `let` to `const`).

## Session: July 8, 2026 — Migration 051: Tiered Dispatch Phase 1 (schema foundation)

**Schema-only migration. No RPC, trigger, lifecycle, realtime, API, or pricing changes.** Implements Phase 1 of the tiered-dispatch plan approved in `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` (D1–D6) plus this session's binding resolutions (R1–R6).

**Read-only verification performed before writing SQL:** confirmed current schema state directly from migrations 001/008/012/031/035/039/045/046/047/049 and from `src/app/api/requests/route.ts` and `src/lib/geo.ts`. Confirmed `submit_quote_atomic` (migration 039) has not been redefined by any later migration (040/044/046/047/048 touch other functions only) — so its `v_daily_limit`/`v_max_active` CASE blocks (lines 213-227) are still the live values. Confirmed `select_quote_atomic`'s `v_plan_limit` (migration 047, lines 104-108) for monthly limits. This caught a factual error in the initial plan (daily quote limit is NOT uniformly 3 across plans — only `pay_per_job`/fallback is 3; starter=5, pro=10, business=20) before it was written into the new SSOT function.

## Session: July 8, 2026 — Migration 052: subscriber-count snapshot (Phase 1 gap closure)

**Schema-only migration.** Closes a gap identified after 051 shipped: `providers_in_range_at_creation` alone cannot distinguish "15 providers, some subscribers" from "15 providers, all PPJ" — same count, opposite zero-subscriber-fallback dispatch behavior.

**Verification performed before writing SQL:** confirmed no column named `subscribers_in_range_at_creation`/`subscriber_count`/`providers_in_range` (other than 051's own `providers_in_range_at_creation`) exists anywhere in the migration history; confirmed 051's file content directly to verify it did not already add this column; `providers_in_range_at_creation` left untouched.

**Created `supabase/migrations/052_subscriber_count_snapshot.sql`:**
- `requests.subscribers_in_range_at_creation` — nullable INTEGER, `DEFAULT NULL`. Frozen count of online subscribers (starter/pro/business, fresh GPS ≤5min) within 150km at request creation. `NULL` = pre-052 row, `0` = zero-subscriber fallback. Populated by the request-creation API in a later phase — no live code writes it yet. Stores a raw count (not a boolean) for the same reasons as 051's `providers_in_range_at_creation`: flexible read-time derivation, future policy tuning, analytics value, same storage cost.
- No other objects. No RPC/API/lifecycle changes.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0. `npm run lint` exit 0. Migration is code-complete but **not yet applied to Supabase**.

**Docs updated:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (new Migration 052 row, next migration number bumped to 053), `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry).

## Session: July 8, 2026 — Correction: migrations 051 and 052 applied and runtime-verified

The "NOT YET APPLIED" status recorded for both migrations above is **superseded**. Both were deployed manually via the Supabase SQL Editor and runtime-verified directly against the live database in this session.

**Runtime verification — 051 (`051_dispatch_foundation_schema.sql`):**
- `requests.providers_in_range_at_creation` exists.
- `requests.destination_emirate` exists.
- `request_quotes.refunded_at` exists.
- `get_provider_limits()` exists and returns the verified live-parity values for all four plans (starter/pro/business/pay_per_job).
- The partial index (`idx_request_quotes_provider_daily_unrefunded`) exists.

**Runtime verification — 052 (`052_subscriber_count_snapshot.sql`):**
- `requests.subscribers_in_range_at_creation` exists with type INTEGER.
- Its `COMMENT` is present.
- No other schema objects changed.

**Docs updated:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (both migration rows changed from CODE COMPLETE — NOT YET APPLIED to APPLIED & RUNTIME-VERIFIED, July 8, 2026; migration baseline bumped to 052), `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` §5 (binding snapshot-consistency design note added for the future API phase), `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry). No code changes in this session — documentation corrections only.

### Files changed
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md`
- `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

---

**Created `supabase/migrations/051_dispatch_foundation_schema.sql`:**
- `requests.providers_in_range_at_creation` — nullable INTEGER. Raw online-provider snapshot count only (D1/R1); the tier bucket is derived from this at read time in a later phase, never stored.
- `requests.destination_emirate` — nullable TEXT + CHECK constraint over the 7 UAE emirates (R6), spelled identically to `src/lib/geo.ts`'s `UAE_REGIONS` names.
- `request_quotes.refunded_at` — nullable TIMESTAMPTZ (D5), mirroring the existing idempotent-marker pattern (`ppj_payments.recovery_credit_restored_at` / `requests.cancellation_compensated_at`). Partial index `idx_request_quotes_provider_daily_unrefunded` on `(provider_id, sent_at) WHERE refunded_at IS NULL` added to support the future daily-quote-count exclusion query.
- `get_provider_limits(p_plan TEXT)` — new SSOT function (R5) returning `(monthly_limit, daily_quote_limit, concurrent_limit)`. Values are exact live-behavior parity with migrations 039/047, verified line-by-line, not changed. `STABLE`, `SET search_path = public`, `REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`, `GRANT EXECUTE TO service_role` only. No existing RPC calls it yet — adoption is Phase 3.
- All new columns default to `NULL`; no backfill (historical snapshot/refund data cannot be reconstructed).

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0. `npm run lint` exit 0. Migration is code-complete but **not yet applied to Supabase**.

**Docs updated:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (§1 snapshot table — new Migration 051 row, next migration number bumped to 052), `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` (new P14 — differentiated daily quote limits are already live, review deferred to Phase 3).

### Files changed

## Session: July 6, 2026 — Read-only check: `select_quote_atomic` ignores `job_credit_balance` (pre-051 bug confirmed)

**Read-only investigation only — no migrations, no code changes.** Follow-up to the migration-051+ conflict analysis (`TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` §4 open question 2).

**Question:** does the live overage gate in `select_quote_atomic` (migration 048, applied) account for `job_credit_balance`, or only the raw plan limit?

**Findings (confirmed by reading migration 048's function body, `stripe/webhook/route.ts`, `provider-allowance.ts`, `monthly-allowance-reset/route.ts`, and `provider/requests/accept/route.ts`):**

1. The live gate compares `jobs_this_month` against a hardcoded `v_plan_limit` (starter=15, pro=35, business unlimited) — **raw only**, no reference to `job_credit_balance` anywhere in the function.
2. Concrete live scenario: a provider upgrades `starter → pro` mid-cycle and is granted `job_credit_balance = 15` (the "preserve upgrade fairness" bonus from migration 008). `jobs_this_month` is not reset on upgrade, so once it reaches 35 (the raw `pro` limit) the dashboard (`getProviderAllowance`) still reports 15 jobs of room (`effectiveLimit = 35 + 15`), but `select_quote_atomic` blocks the very next quote selection with `overage_required` — contradicting what the provider was just told.
3. `job_credit_balance` is granted on upgrade and zeroed on downgrade/monthly reset (`stripe/webhook/route.ts`, `monthly-allowance-reset/route.ts`) but is **never consumed/decremented anywhere** — no RPC reads it, and the only other code path that selects it (`provider/requests/accept/route.ts`) is dead (every plan branch returns a hardcoded 403).
4. This is **not a new 051 feature** — it's a pre-existing inconsistency between the dashboard (crediting since migration 008) and the enforcement gate (never crediting, since 031/040/047/048).

**Action taken:** added a standalone note to `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` (§4, after the open questions) flagging this as independent of 051 and requiring Q2's resolution to cover consumption semantics for both the existing select-time gate and the new submit-time gate.

## Session: July 5, 2026 (later) — Honest quote-form errors + dismissible cancellation notice

**Two provider-dashboard UX fixes confirmed by this session's read-only analysis. Frontend + i18n only — no migrations, no RPCs, no rate-limit or lifecycle changes.**

### Fix 1 — Quote form showed "too many attempts" for the daily quote limit

**Root cause:** `ProviderQuoteForm.tsx` checked `res.status === 429` before parsing the response body, so ALL 429s rendered as `tooManyAttempts` — including the RPC's `daily_limit_reached`, which `/api/provider/jobs/quote` maps to HTTP 429. During repeated same-day testing, PPJ providers (3 quotes/day, counted from `request_quotes.sent_at::DATE = CURRENT_DATE` regardless of quote status) hit the daily quota, and the first quote of a new session showed a misleading "too many attempts" error. 403 cases (role/inactive/offline) fell through to raw English server strings.

**Verified before changing:** the route already returns a stable `code` field for all RPC-mapped errors (`code: reason`, including `daily_limit_reached`) — so NO route change was needed. The limiter 429 carries no `code`; route-level 403s carry only `error` strings.

**Change (`src/components/provider/ProviderQuoteForm.tsx`):** parse the body first, then branch: `code === 'daily_limit_reached'` → new `dailyQuoteLimitReached` message; other 429 → `tooManyAttempts` (true rate limit); 403 → new `accountNotEligible`; everything else unchanged (`result.error ?? quoteSubmitFailed`).

### Fix 2 — Customer-cancellation notice not dismissible

**Root cause:** the notice renders in the dashboard Server Component for 24 hours after `cancelled_at` (`isRecentOperationalNotice`) with no dismiss mechanism.

**Change:** new client component `src/components/provider/DismissibleNotice.tsx` — wraps the server-rendered notice, adds an X button (translated `aria-label`), and hides it per request id via `sessionStorage` (`rescuego:notice-dismissed:<requestId>`). Dismissal lasts only for the browser session; the 24 h window logic is untouched; the recent-activity feed remains the permanent record. localStorage intentionally NOT used. The dashboard wraps the existing notice card in this component.

### Files changed

- `src/components/provider/ProviderQuoteForm.tsx` — body-first error branching
- `src/components/provider/DismissibleNotice.tsx` — NEW client component
- `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx` — import + wrap cancellation notice
- `messages/ar.json`, `messages/en.json` — `components.providerRequestList.dailyQuoteLimitReached` ("لقد وصلت إلى الحد اليومي لعروض الأسعار — يتجدد غدًا."), `components.providerRequestList.accountNotEligible` ("حسابك غير مؤهل لإرسال عروض الأسعار حاليًا."), `provider.dashboard.dismissNotice` ("إغلاق التنبيه")
- `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0; `npm run lint` → exit 0; both message files parse as valid JSON.
- Runtime steps: (1) provider at daily quota submits a quote → sees the daily-limit message, not "too many attempts"; (2) >30 rapid submits in 60 s → still sees `tooManyAttempts` (true limiter); (3) suspended/offline provider → `accountNotEligible`; (4) cancellation notice shows an X — dismissing hides it immediately and it stays hidden after `router.refresh()`/reload within the same tab session, reappears in a new session while still inside the 24 h window; (5) recent-activity feed unchanged; (6) RTL: X button sits at the logical end (start-flipped correctly), aria-label in Arabic.

## Session: July 5, 2026 (later) — Provider PPJ payment card stale after customer cancellation (UI/realtime fix)

**Bug (reproduced in production):** customer cancelled a PPJ request during the payment window (migration 049 path — backend correct: `status='cancelled'`, hold released). The provider dashboard kept showing the "pay 15 AED" card with a running countdown; clicking Pay surfaced the raw English server string "Request is not awaiting your payment, or your selection has expired." inside the Arabic UI.

### Root cause

No signal ever reached the provider client, and the card is prop-frozen:

1. `ProviderRealtimeRefresh` had three channels, none of which could deliver the cancel event: the `requests` UPDATE channel filters `status=eq.open` (filter applies to the NEW row — a cancel produces `status='cancelled'`); the `request_quotes` channel never fires because `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` does not touch quote rows; the per-request channel was keyed to `activeRequestId = activeRequest?.id`, which is `null` during `selected_pending_payment` (no active job yet), so the held request was subscribed to by nothing.
2. `PpjPaymentPrompt`'s countdown is client-only, computed from the initial `paymentWindowStartedAt` prop; it only refreshes when it reaches 0.
3. The checkout 404 error string was rendered verbatim (`setError(result?.error || ...)`) — untranslated English.

Not a caching issue: the dashboard is a request-time dynamic Server Component and its `pendingPaymentRequest` query is fresh per render; a manual refresh already cleared the card.

### Fix (client/UI only — no migrations, no lifecycle/RPC/payment logic changes)

- `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`: pass `activeRequestId={activeRequest?.id ?? pendingPaymentRequest?.id ?? null}` to `ProviderRealtimeRefresh` — during the payment window the existing per-request channel now subscribes to the held request, so the customer's cancel UPDATE triggers `router.refresh()`, unmounting the card and stopping the countdown. Also added `accepted_at` to the customer-cancellation notice query/type and, when `accepted_at IS NULL` (cancelled before payment — nothing was paid), the notice now shows `provider.ppjPaymentPrompt.cancelledByCustomer` instead of the misleading "payment protected"/"usage restored" copy.
- `src/components/provider/PpjPaymentPrompt.tsx`: on checkout failure with HTTP 404 or `code === 'SELECTION_NOT_PENDING'`, show translated `t('selectionNoLongerAvailable')` instead of the raw server string, and call `router.refresh()` so the stale card clears even if the realtime event was missed.
- `src/app/api/provider/ppj-checkout/route.ts`: the existing 404 response now also carries `code: 'SELECTION_NOT_PENDING'` (additive; status code and business logic unchanged).
- `messages/ar.json` + `messages/en.json`: added `provider.ppjPaymentPrompt.cancelledByCustomer` ("ألغى العميل الطلب قبل إتمام الدفع") and `provider.ppjPaymentPrompt.selectionNoLongerAvailable` ("هذا الطلب لم يعد بانتظار دفعتك — ربما ألغاه العميل أو انتهت مهلة الاختيار.").

### Files changed

- `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `src/components/provider/PpjPaymentPrompt.tsx`
- `src/app/api/provider/ppj-checkout/route.ts`
- `messages/ar.json`, `messages/en.json`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (also corrected stale claims: migrations 048, 049, 050 were all applied and runtime-verified in Supabase on July 5, 2026), `SESSION_LOG.md`

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0; `npm run lint` → exit 0; both message files re-parsed as valid JSON.
- Runtime steps: select PPJ quote → card shows; customer cancels during window → provider card disappears within ~5 s (realtime refresh) and the notice "ألغى العميل الطلب قبل إتمام الدفع" renders; racing the Pay button shows the translated `selectionNoLongerAvailable` message (no raw English) and clears on refresh; provider continues receiving new requests.

## Session: July 5, 2026 — Production rating 500: migration 046 regression in `update_provider_rating` (migration 050)

**Context:** Owner reported that customer rating submission returned 500 after the first fully completed PPJ job (quote → selection → PPJ payment → accepted → en_route → arrived → in_progress → completed). Read-only analysis identified the cause; owner confirmed it live in production (`pg_proc.prosrc` contains `score`; rating insert fails with Postgres 42703).

### Root cause

Migration `046_revoke_anon_execute_and_fix_search_path.sql` recreated the trigger function `public.update_provider_rating` to add `SET search_path = public` (Supabase Security Advisor Category C). Despite the migration's header claiming the bodies were "byte-for-byte identical", the rewritten body reads a non-existent column:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(AVG(score), 0) ... ( SELECT score FROM ratings ... )
```

The `ratings` table has **`stars`** (migration 001), never `score` — a repo-wide search of all migrations confirms `score` appears only inside 046's rewritten body. PL/pgSQL does not validate column references at `CREATE FUNCTION` time, so 046 applied cleanly and the defect only surfaced at runtime.

### Exact failing function and why every rating insert failed

- Failing function: `public.update_provider_rating()` — fired by `trigger_update_provider_rating` (AFTER INSERT ON `ratings`, migration 001).
- Every `INSERT INTO ratings` (from `POST /api/ratings`) aborts inside the trigger with Postgres error 42703 `column "score" does not exist`; the route returns a generic 500 and logs `rating_submit_failed`.
- Not PPJ-specific: any completed job (subscriber or PPJ) hits the same failure. The PPJ job was simply the first rating attempted after 046 was applied.

### What migration 050 changes

`supabase/migrations/050_fix_update_provider_rating_stars_column.sql` — `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_provider_rating()` with the ORIGINAL migration 001 body: `ROUND(AVG(stars)::NUMERIC, 2)` over the provider's last 50 ratings ordered by `created_at DESC`, updating `providers.rating`, returning `NEW`. The only addition is the legitimate 046 security option `SET search_path = public`. The trigger binding is untouched (`CREATE OR REPLACE` preserves it); no grants/revokes needed (trigger functions are not REST-callable); migration 046 was not modified (applied migrations are immutable); no other function, table, policy, or RPC touched. No application code changed.

### Mandatory diff result

Unified diff of the function in 050 vs the original in 001: the body between `BEGIN` and `END;` is **byte-for-byte identical** (programmatic comparison returned `BODY BYTE-IDENTICAL: True`). Only accepted differences: header schema-qualifies the name (`public.update_provider_rating`) and the options line changes from `LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;` to `LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public;`.

### Files changed

- `supabase/migrations/050_fix_update_provider_rating_stars_column.sql` (NEW — 43 lines)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (snapshot, migration baseline → next number 051, 046 advisor section corrected, new migration 050 section)
- `SESSION_LOG.md` (this entry)

### Verification done this session

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0
- `npm run lint` → exit 0
- Programmatic body diff 001 vs 050 (see above)

### Runtime verification steps still required

1. Apply migration 050 in the Supabase SQL Editor.
2. Submit the pending rating again in the customer UI (stars + comment).
3. Confirm `rating_submitted` succeeds (200; log event `rating_submitted`, no `rating_submit_failed`).
4. Confirm `providers.rating` updated from `ratings.stars` (`SELECT rating FROM providers WHERE id = '<provider_id>';` = rounded average of last 50 ratings).
5. Confirm a duplicate rating for the same job returns 409.

## Session: July 3, 2026 — Stuck PPJ selection: cancel path + duplicate-request guard (migration 049)

**Context:** Owner reported that after migrations 047/048, a customer request "disappeared": only the selected PPJ provider could see it, it vanished from subscriber dashboards, and a new request the customer tried to create left no trace (newest visible request in `/customer/history` remained June 29).

### Root cause analysis

Not a data-corruption issue and not caused by migrations 047/048. Verified by reading the full fetch/display chain (`get_nearby_open_requests` in migration 039, provider dashboard fetch in `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`, `ProviderRequestList.tsx`, `customer/history/page.tsx`) — none of it branches by plan. Actual sequence:

1. Customer request reached `quoted`; customer selected a PPJ quote; `select_quote_atomic` set `status = 'selected_pending_payment'` and `accepted_by = <PPJ provider>`.
2. While held, `get_nearby_open_requests` (filters `status IN ('open','quoted') AND accepted_by IS NULL`) hides it from all other providers — this is why only the PPJ provider saw it (intended hold behavior, not a bug).
3. The PPJ provider never paid; the marketplace cron (every minute, `vercel.json`) released it back to `quoted` via `expire_ppj_payment_selection_atomic`.
4. The request stayed ACTIVE (`quoted`), so the duplicate-request guard in `POST /api/requests` rejected the new request with 409 — the "new" request was never created. `/customer/history` shows the old request at its original June 29 date; the active request surface is `/customer/request`.

Two real defects were exposed:

- **Guard mismatch:** `GET /api/requests` treated `selected_pending_payment` as active but the `POST` duplicate guard did not — a customer could create a second request during the PPJ payment window.
- **Lock-out risk:** once POST also blocks during `selected_pending_payment`, the customer must be able to cancel that request — but `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` (migration 034) did not include `selected_pending_payment` in its cancellable-status list, so the customer would be stuck until the cron released it.

### Files changed

- `src/app/api/requests/route.ts` — POST duplicate guard status list now includes `'selected_pending_payment'` (matches GET) + explanatory comment.
- `supabase/migrations/049_allow_cancel_selected_pending_payment.sql` — new. Recreates `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` identical to migration 034 with ONE functional change: `'selected_pending_payment'` added to the cancellable `status IN (...)` filter. REVOKE/GRANT re-applied (service_role only).
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — 1/3/9 updated: migration 049 CODE COMPLETE — NOT YET APPLIED; next migration number 050.

### Why migration 049 was required

Migration 034 is the latest applied definition of `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` and is immutable. Its cancel UPDATE filter omitted `selected_pending_payment`, so a customer-initiated cancel of a pending PPJ selection returned `request_status_changed`. Compensation safety: `v_is_late` only considers `('accepted','en_route','arrived','in_progress')`, so cancelling a pending-payment selection is NOT late and grants no provider compensation — correct, since the provider never paid the fee.

### Verification (this session)

- Confirmed 049 vs 034: single functional line change (`status IN` list); rest of function body identical (line-by-line comparison, comments stripped).
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: exit 0.
- `npm run lint`: exit 0.
- Committed as `cabdb4f`.

### Runtime verification still required (after applying migration 049 in Supabase SQL Editor)

1. Apply `049_allow_cancel_selected_pending_payment.sql` manually (048 also still pending).
2. Create a request, submit a quote, select a PPJ provider (do not pay) — request enters `selected_pending_payment`.
3. As the customer on `/customer/request`, cancel the request — must succeed (previously returned "could not be cancelled").
4. Immediately create a new request — must succeed after the cancel; must be blocked with 409 while the selection is still pending.
5. Confirm the PPJ provider received no compensation for the cancel (no recovery credit granted).

## Session: July 2, 2026 — Migration 048: provider-row FOR UPDATE correction (047 immutable)

**Context:** Migration 047 was applied manually to Supabase BEFORE the provider-row `FOR UPDATE` fix was committed locally (in a prior local-only edit). Migration 047 is therefore immutable and must match the applied version exactly. The lock correction moves to a new corrective migration 048.

### What was verified

- Read migration 047 in full. It contained a local-only `FOR UPDATE` edit (comment block + `FOR UPDATE`) on the provider row SELECT — the edit that must NOT be in 047 because 047 was already applied without it.
- Confirmed the applied version of 047 = git commit `062e233` (the original commit); the local `FOR UPDATE` edit was commit `c959312`.
- Reverted only that edit in 047. `git diff 062e233 -- 047...sql` returns empty (exit 0) — 047 now matches the applied version byte-for-byte.
- Diffed 047 vs 048 `select_quote_atomic`: the only differences are removal of `WHERE id = v_provider_id;` and addition of `WHERE id = v_provider_id` + `FOR UPDATE;` (plus one explanatory comment line). PPJ branch, subscriber branch (except the lock), signature, RETURNS TABLE, and grants are identical.

### Why 048 was needed

Migration 047 (applied) has no provider-row lock in the subscriber overage path. Without it, two concurrent `select_quote_atomic` calls selecting the same at-limit provider (via two different requests) could both read `jobs_this_month` below the limit, both pass the overage gate, and both increment — bypassing the monthly limit (TOCTOU). The `requests FOR UPDATE` does not protect the provider row across different requests. Since 047 is immutable, the fix is delivered as migration 048.

### What changed

- `supabase/migrations/047_...sql`: reverted the local FOR UPDATE edit; now identical to the applied version.
- `supabase/migrations/048_fix_provider_lock_select_quote_atomic.sql`: new. `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.select_quote_atomic(UUID, UUID, UUID)` + full recreate of the function with the single functional change (provider row `FOR UPDATE`) + re-applied `REVOKE ALL FROM anon, authenticated` and `GRANT EXECUTE TO service_role`.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: §1 snapshot, §3 migration baseline, §5 LB-7, §7 H3, §8 updated — 047 applied, 048 required and NOT YET APPLIED, LB-7 CODE COMPLETE pending 048 cloud application.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit`: exit 0.
- `npm run lint`: exit 0.

**Migration 048 is FILE ONLY and must still be applied to Supabase SQL Editor.** LB-7 is not fully closed in cloud until 048 is applied.

---

## Session: July 2, 2026 — FOR UPDATE provider lock in select_quote_atomic (migration 047 correction)

**Goal:** Verify whether the provider row is locked (`FOR UPDATE`) in the subscriber overage path of `select_quote_atomic`, and correct migration 047 if the lock is missing.

### What was verified

- **Repo file `supabase/migrations/047_overage_gate_v2_and_sla_reset_atomic.sql`:** the providers SELECT after `v_provider_id` is set (originally lines 74–75) read `SELECT * INTO v_provider FROM providers WHERE id = v_provider_id;` — **NO `FOR UPDATE`**. The `requests` SELECT (line 42) already had `FOR UPDATE`; the providers SELECT did not.
- **Live database `pg_proc` query — COULD NOT BE RUN.** No `psql` binary, no `supabase` CLI, no local `supabase/config.toml`, and no direct Postgres connection string (`DATABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_DB_URL` / `POSTGRES_URL` all unset; `.env.local` contains only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, which is the REST endpoint and cannot execute `SELECT prosrc FROM pg_proc`). The user constraint "do not apply anything to Supabase SQL Editor" also rules out the SQL Editor. Live function body could not be inspected from this environment.
- **Migration 047 is NOT YET APPLIED to cloud** (per prior July 2 entry). The live `select_quote_atomic` is therefore still the migration 045 body, which has no LB-7 subscriber overage branch at all — so the live function cannot yet contain this lock regardless.

### What was found

The repo migration 047 lacked `FOR UPDATE` on the provider row read in the subscriber path. This is a TOCTOU risk: without locking the provider row, two concurrent `select_quote_atomic` calls selecting the same at-limit provider (via two different requests) could both read `jobs_this_month` below the limit, both pass the overage gate, and both increment `jobs_this_month` — bypassing the monthly limit. The `requests FOR UPDATE` does not protect the provider row across different requests.

### What was changed

- `supabase/migrations/047_overage_gate_v2_and_sla_reset_atomic.sql`: added `FOR UPDATE` to the providers SELECT (now lines 80–82) plus an explanatory comment describing the TOCTOU race the lock prevents. PPJ branch and all other logic unchanged.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit`: exit 0.
- `npm run lint`: exit 0.
- (SQL migration content is not exercised by tsc/lint; these confirm no TypeScript/lint regression from the repo state.)

**Migration 047 still NOT YET APPLIED to cloud Supabase.** Apply migrations 046 + 047 in order via SQL Editor before the next production deploy. The `FOR UPDATE` correction is now part of the migration that will be applied.

---

## Session: July 2, 2026 — LB-6 + LB-7 + LB-10

**Goal:** Close three launch blockers: LB-6 (legacy accept route bypasses V2 for subscribers), LB-7 (no overage gate in select_quote_atomic), LB-10 (weekly SLA reset non-atomic).

### Change 1 — LB-6: accept/route.ts V2 guard

**Pre-change verification:**
- PPJ guard block ends at line 110 (`}`), blank line 111, `if (!providerLocation)` at line 112.
- PPJ guard returns 403 `PPJ_PAYMENT_REQUIRED` for `plan === 'pay_per_job'`.
- No prior V2 guard existed.

**Applied:** Inserted unconditional V2 guard block after PPJ guard. Subscription providers (starter/pro/business) now receive 403 `V2_QUOTE_REQUIRED`. Legacy accept path (providerLocation check, activeJob check, overage guard, `accept_provider_request_atomic` RPC) removed since it is now unreachable for all plans.

**TypeScript fix:** `provider.plan !== 'pay_per_job'` at line 112 caused TS2367 (types have no overlap after PPJ guard narrowing). Guard made unconditional; unused imports and variables cleaned up. Final: tsc exit 0, lint exit 0 (no warnings).

**Final file:** `accept/route.ts` — 115 lines. PPJ guard lines 76–90, V2 guard lines 92–108. All pre-flight checks preserved (role, 404, status). Legacy code removed, preserved in git history.

### Change 2 — LB-7 + LB-10: migration 047

**Pre-change verification:**
- Migration 045 subscriber branch: `UPDATE requests SET status = 'accepted'` starts at line 209. No overage/plan_limit check precedes `jobs_this_month` UPDATE at line 232. Confirmed.
- `weekly-sla-reset/route.ts`: first UPDATE (`visibility_reduced = true`) at line 44, second UPDATE (`sla_failure_count = 0`) at line 57. Not in a transaction. Confirmed.
- Grep `weekly_sla_reset_atomic` across migrations 001–046: zero results. Confirmed new function.

**Applied:** Created `supabase/migrations/047_overage_gate_v2_and_sla_reset_atomic.sql`.

- **LB-7 (select_quote_atomic):** DROP + CREATE OR REPLACE with overage gate in subscriber branch. `v_plan_limit`: starter=15, pro=35, business=-1 (unlimited). Gate fires when `jobs_this_month >= v_plan_limit AND NOT overage_cleared`. Returns `overage_required`. PPJ branch byte-for-byte identical to migration 045 (lines 80–103 of migration 047).
- **LB-10 (weekly_sla_reset_atomic):** New `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC. LIMIT 500 prevents unbounded fetch. `visibility_reduced = TRUE` and `sla_failure_count = 0` execute atomically in one transaction. Returns `(providers_reset INT, visibility_reduced_count INT)`.
- Both functions: `REVOKE ALL FROM anon, authenticated` + `GRANT TO service_role`.

**Migration 047 NOT YET APPLIED to cloud Supabase SQL Editor.** Apply after code review.

### Change 3 — LB-10: weekly-sla-reset/route.ts

**Pre-change verification:**
- Line 44: `update({ visibility_reduced: true })` — first non-atomic UPDATE. Confirmed.
- Line 57: `update({ sla_failure_count: 0 })` — second non-atomic UPDATE. Confirmed.
- No RPC call existed in file. Confirmed.

**Applied:** Replaced entire try block content with single `supabase.rpc('weekly_sla_reset_atomic')` call. Route structure, auth (`authorizeOpsRequest`), exports (`GET`, `POST`), and response shape (`{ success: true, providers_reset, visibility_reduced_count, errors }`) unchanged. `results` object still declared with `errors` array (preserved for shape compatibility). No direct UPDATE statements remain.

**Post-change verification:** File is 62 lines. No UPDATE statements. Auth and exports byte-for-byte unchanged.

### Change 4 — tsc + lint

- `npx tsc --noEmit`: exit 0, no errors.
- `npm run lint`: exit 0, no warnings.

### Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/app/api/provider/requests/accept/route.ts` | LB-6: V2 guard added, legacy accept path removed, unused imports cleaned |
| `supabase/migrations/047_overage_gate_v2_and_sla_reset_atomic.sql` | New — LB-7 overage gate + LB-10 atomic SLA reset RPC |
| `src/app/api/ops/weekly-sla-reset/route.ts` | LB-10: replaced two non-atomic UPDATEs with weekly_sla_reset_atomic() RPC call |
| `PROJECT_STATUS.md` | §1, §3, §5, §6 LB-6/LB-7, §7 H2/H3, §8, §13 P4-H3 updated |

### Note on migration 047

Migration 047 is **code complete and committed** but has **not been applied to cloud Supabase**. Until applied:
- LB-7 overage gate is inactive in production (select_quote_atomic still uses migration 045 body).
- LB-10 atomic SLA reset is inactive (route falls back to error until RPC exists in Supabase).
- Apply via Supabase SQL Editor before next production deploy.

## Session: July 2, 2026 — Supabase Security Advisor: anon EXECUTE + search_path (migration 046)

**Goal:** Address 44 Supabase Security Advisor warnings. Grepped all 001–045 migrations to determine which functions already had REVOKE FROM anon or SET search_path in prior migrations, then wrote migration 046 for the remaining gaps only.

### Task 1 — Per-function verification findings

| `finalize_ppj_selection_atomic` | YES | migration 045 |
| `request_price_change_atomic` | YES | migration 040 |
| `respond_price_change_atomic` | YES | migration 040 |
| `expire_stale_open_requests` | NO | needs REVOKE — included in 046 |
| `expire_ppj_payment_selection_atomic` | YES | migration 045 |

### Verification
- REVOKE count: 2 — matches the 2 functions confirmed needing it.
- `SET search_path = public` confirmed in all 4 recreated function bodies (lines 92, 135, 172, 188).
- False-positive functions confirmed absent via grep (zero results).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0.
- `npm run lint` exit 0.

### Files changed
- `supabase/migrations/046_revoke_anon_execute_and_fix_search_path.sql` — new migration (191 lines)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` §13 — new finding entry added: "Supabase Advisor — anon EXECUTE and function_search_path_mutable (Migration 046)"

**NOTE: Migration 046 has NOT YET been applied to the cloud Supabase project.** Must be applied via SQL Editor. After applying, rerun Supabase Security Advisor and confirm warning count drops by at least 6.

## Session: July 1, 2026 — Cloud migration verification (LB-2 + LB-3 closed)

**Goal:** Verify all 45 migrations are applied to the production Supabase project and confirm the C2/C3 security triggers are present in cloud, closing LB-2 and LB-3.

**What was verified:**
- Ran the §2 sentinel query against the production Supabase SQL Editor: all 5 sentinel functions returned (`enforce_users_immutable_columns`, `enforce_providers_immutable_columns`, `finalize_ppj_selection_atomic`, `expire_ppj_payment_selection_atomic`, `admin_update_provider_status_atomic`).
- `fair_price_config` confirmed showing migration 044 values (`min_price_per_km = 0.01`, `max_price_per_km = 10000`) for all service types.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.request_quotes` → 25 rows (table present — migration 031 applied).
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.provider_kyc_log` → 3 rows (table present — migration 038 applied).
- `SELECT relname FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'idx_jobs_en_route_at'` → 0 rows (migration 043 index was missing from cloud).
- Applied `idx_jobs_en_route_at` index directly via SQL Editor using the statement from migration 043.
- C2/C3 trigger functions confirmed present in `pg_proc`.

**What was found:**
- All migrations 001–045 effectively applied, with one gap: migration 043's index (`idx_jobs_en_route_at`) had not been applied — remedied immediately via SQL Editor.
- Both security trigger functions (C2 and C3) confirmed present in cloud.

**What was updated in PROJECT_STATUS.md:**
- §1 snapshot: cloud migration verification updated from "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" to "VERIFIED — all migrations 001–045 confirmed applied (July 1, 2026)".
- §2 Supabase paragraph: updated to confirm all 45 migrations applied, with verification details.
- §3 table: `Cloud state` row changed to "VERIFIED — all migrations 001–045 confirmed applied (July 1, 2026)".
- §3 prose: removed "required before launch" sentence; replaced with confirmation.
- §4 Runtime Verification table: C2 row → "VERIFIED — trigger confirmed in cloud pg_proc July 1, 2026"; C3 row → same; P4-M1 row → "VERIFIED — index applied directly via SQL Editor July 1, 2026".
- §5 blockers table: LB-2 and LB-3 rows marked "CLOSED July 1, 2026".
- §6 LB-2 section: replaced INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE description with CLOSED status and full verification evidence.
- §6 LB-3 section: replaced PARTIALLY VERIFIED description with CLOSED status.
- §7 C2 section: updated from PARTIALLY VERIFIED to VERIFIED; removed "Runtime verification required" note.
- §7 C3 section: updated from PARTIALLY VERIFIED to VERIFIED; corrected column count from 20 to 19 (matching Phase 4A-5 fix); removed "Runtime verification required" note.

**Committed:** `4b7faf8` docs: close LB-2 and LB-3 -- cloud migration verification complete (July 1, 2026)

## Session: July 1, 2026 — Housekeeping: package-lock, .env.example, docs corrections, rate limits, i18n

**Goal:** Apply 8 targeted housekeeping tasks covering dependency hygiene, environment documentation, security findings closure, JSON-LD correctness, i18n completeness, rate limiting, and documentation accuracy. Verify-first policy applied to every task.

**Task 1 — package-lock desync (SKIPPED — already correct):**
Ran `npm ci`. Completed cleanly: "added 504 packages, audited 505 packages." No missing dependency errors. No change made.

**Task 2 — .env.example (CREATED):**
Verified `.env.example` existed on disk but was blocked by `.gitignore` line 34 (`.env*` rule) — `git check-ignore -v .env.example` confirmed it was untrackable. Added `!.env.example` exception at `.gitignore` line 35. Created `.env.example` (78 lines, 9 variable groups, placeholder values only) sourced from `SETUP.md §3`. Groups: Supabase, Stripe, PPJ fees, Feature flags, Google Maps, Application URLs, Support email, Ops/Cron secret, Upstash Redis, Sentry. Confirmed trackable post-fix via `git status`. Committed `a0e8524`.
- `.gitignore` line 35: added `!.env.example`
- `.env.example`: new file, 78 lines

**Task 3 — Close LB-5 (CLOSED in docs):**
Verified `029_rpc_add_en_route_arrived_statuses.sql` line 231: `AND status IN ('accepted', 'en_route', 'arrived', 'in_progress')` — the active-job guard covers all four active states. Grepped migrations 030–045 for any redefinition of `accept_provider_request_atomic`: zero results. Fix is confirmed present in code since migration 029. LB-5 was incorrectly left open in docs.
Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md`:
- §5 blockers table: removed LB-5 row (was between LB-4 and LB-6).
- §6 LB-5 section: replaced OPEN description with CLOSED — fixed in migration 029 (supersedes 024 line 56); verified in source.
- §7 H6 section: updated from OPEN to CLOSED with same evidence.
Committed `b3293e0`.

**Task 4 — Fix logo reference in JSON-LD (FIXED):**
Verified `public/logo.png` absent; `public/logo.svg` present. Grepped all `*.tsx`/`*.ts` files in `src/` for `logo.png`: two hits.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` line 74: changed `/logo.png` → `/logo.svg` (JSON-LD Organization schema)
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` line 19: changed `/logo.png` → `/logo.svg` (JSON-LD Organization schema)
No other references to `logo.png` found anywhere in `src/` or `public/`. Committed `70efc50`. Partial closure of LB-9.

**Task 5 — Add missing PPJ keys to en.json (FIXED):**
Compared `messages/ar.json` and `messages/en.json` under `admin.requests.lifecycle` using Python JSON parse. Found 4 keys present in `ar.json` missing from `en.json`:
- `awaitingPaymentTitle` — Arabic: "بانتظار تأكيد الدفع" → English added: "Awaiting Payment Confirmation"
- `awaitingPaymentDesc` — Arabic: multi-sentence provider-selection awaiting-payment description → English: "A provider has been selected. Their details will be shown after they confirm payment. If they do not confirm within 10 minutes, you can select another provider."
- `awaitingPaymentBadge` — Arabic: "بانتظار دفع مقدم الخدمة" → English added: "Awaiting Provider Payment"
- `ppjPaymentTimeoutNotice` — Arabic: "لم يؤكد مقدم الخدمة الدفع، يرجى اختيار مقدم خدمة آخر." → English added: "The provider did not confirm payment. Please select another provider."
Inserted after `messages/en.json` line 1601 (`"unassigned": "Unassigned"`). JSON validated with Python `json.load` — no syntax errors. Committed `5945fb4`.
- `messages/en.json` lines 1602–1605: 4 new keys added

**Task 6 — Add rate limiting to two routes (FIXED):**
Verified neither route called `checkRateLimitAsync` before change.
- `src/app/api/provider/jobs/release/route.ts`:
  - Line 6: added `import { checkRateLimitAsync } from '@/lib/rate-limit'`
  - Lines 42–48: rate limit call after role check (line 38–40), before `createAdminClient()` (line 50). Key `provider-release-job:${user.id}`, 10 req / 60 s, mode `'soft'`. Returns 429 + `Retry-After` on breach.
- `src/app/api/customers/unrated-jobs/route.ts`:
  - Line 4: added `import { checkRateLimitAsync } from '@/lib/rate-limit'`
  - Lines 28–34: rate limit call after role check (line 24–26), before `createAdminClient()` (line 36). Key `customer-unrated-jobs:${user.id}`, 30 req / 60 s, mode `'soft'`. Returns 429 + `Retry-After` on breach.
`npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0. `npm run lint` exit 0. Committed `3ba702a`.

**Task 7 — ARCHITECTURE.md ppj_payments columns + missing RPC (FIXED):**
(a) Read `supabase/migrations/005_ppj_payments.sql`. Actual columns: `id`, `provider_id`, `request_id`, `fee_aed` INTEGER NOT NULL, `distance_meters` INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `status` CHECK ('pending','paid','failed') DEFAULT 'pending', `promo_applied` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE, `created_at`. Docs had `amount_aed` (wrong name), `accept_failed` (non-existent column), and omitted `fee_aed`, `distance_meters`, `promo_applied`. Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` §2 `ppj_payments` row to match actual schema (migration 005 lines 3–12).
(b) Grepped all migrations for `restore_ppj_credit_for_cancelled_paid_request`: found in `012_ppj_cancelled_payment_protection.sql`. Signature: `(p_provider_id UUID, p_request_id UUID, p_payment_intent_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL)`. Purpose: restores one `ppj_recovery_credits` credit idempotently when a customer cancels after a PPJ provider has paid. Absent from the RPC catalog. Added to `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 after the `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` row.
Committed `ea68e67`.

**Task 8 — Stray file (SKIPPED — not found):**
Searched entire repo outside `node_modules` for any filename containing `#U`. `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` with `Where-Object { $_.Name -match "#U" }` returned zero results. `git status --short | Select-String "#U"` also returned nothing. No file to delete.

**Final build:** `npm run build` — zero errors, zero warnings. All routes compiled. Committed documentation changes (archive + Phase 4B) separately in prior session; these 7 commits are all housekeeping.

**Verification results:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0 (no type errors)
- `npm run lint` exit 0 (no lint errors)
- `npm run build` succeeded — all routes compile (exit 0)
- logo.png: zero remaining references in `src/` or `public/`
- Atomic RPC files (`040`, `045`, `webhook/route.ts`, `accept/route.ts`): untouched — `git diff HEAD` returns 0 bytes
- Rate limit pattern: both routes confirmed — call after `getUser()`/role check, before DB; 429 + Retry-After on breach; correct key format; mode `'soft'`

**Commits this session:**
- `a0e8524` docs: add .env.example with all required environment variables
- `b3293e0` docs: close LB-5 — accept RPC en_route/arrived already fixed in migration 029
- `70efc50` fix: correct JSON-LD logo reference from .png to .svg (LB-9 partial)
- `5945fb4` fix: add missing PPJ lifecycle i18n keys to en.json
- `3ba702a` fix: add rate limiting to release and unrated-jobs routes
- `ea68e67` docs: fix ppj_payments column list and add restore_ppj_credit RPC to ARCHITECTURE catalog

## Session: June 28, 2026 — PPJ re-enabled (NEW MODEL): post-selection fee gate (migration 045 + code)

**Goal (P7):** Re-enable Pay Per Job under a new model — PPJ providers quote like everyone; the per-job fee is charged AFTER the customer selects their quote, before contact details are revealed and the job is assigned. Subscribers are unaffected (immediate reveal + assign).

**Migration `045_ppj_post_selection_fee_gate.sql` (NOT yet applied — paste into Supabase SQL editor):**
- Adds request status `selected_pending_payment`; columns `requests.payment_window_started_at` and `requests.last_release_reason`; widens `provider_dispatch_log.event_type` to allow `ppj_payment_timeout`; partial index `idx_requests_payment_window_pending`.
- `select_quote_atomic` plan-branched (return shape gains `payment_required`): subscriber path byte-for-byte unchanged; PPJ path → `selected_pending_payment`, holds competitors as `pending`, withholds contact, `accepted_at` stays NULL.
- New `finalize_ppj_selection_atomic` — webhook on fee payment: `selected_pending_payment → accepted`, sets `accepted_at = now()` (SLA starts ONLY here), rejects held competitors, reveals contact, verifies payer is the selected provider.
- New `expire_ppj_payment_selection_atomic` — cron, 10-min: releases to `quoted`/`open`, sets `last_release_reason = 'ppj_payment_timeout'`, marks unpaid `ppj_payments` row `failed`, no SLA penalty, no jobs change.

**Two timers — proven separate:** the 10-min payment window keys off `payment_window_started_at`; the SLA clock keys off `accepted_at` (set only at payment). `sla_check_and_release` only acts on `accepted/en_route/arrived`, so `selected_pending_payment` is structurally immune → an unpaid-but-selected PPJ provider can never get an SLA penalty.

**Code:**
- `customer/quote/select/route.ts` — returns `payment_required` (no contact for PPJ).
- `provider/ppj-checkout/route.ts` — accepts `selected_pending_payment`; verifies the caller is the selected provider; recovery-credit path now finalizes via the new RPC.
- `api/requests/route.ts` GET — withholds provider contact while `selected_pending_payment` (no pre-payment leak); returns `last_release_reason`.
- `stripe/webhook/route.ts` — PPJ branch calls `finalize_ppj_selection_atomic` (overage branch untouched).
- `ops/marketplace-cron/route.ts` — separate `expirePpjPaymentWindows()` pass.
- New `components/provider/PpjPaymentPrompt.tsx` — "pay 15 AED to reveal details" + 10-min countdown + 5-min warning (UI-only).
- `provider/dashboard/page.tsx` — query + render the pending-payment prompt.
- `customer/request/page.tsx` — "awaiting payment" state + Arabic timeout notice.
- `types/database.ts` — `RequestStatus` + `DispatchEventType` extended.
- `messages/ar.json` + `messages/en.json` — new keys (Arabic-first).

**Safety:** subscriber selection path unchanged; H1 (no KYC docs returned) preserved; C5 fair-price validation untouched; CRIT-02 SLA untouched; 403 PPJ guard kept.

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` = 0, `npm run lint` = 0, `npm run build` = 0. JSON files parse.

## Session: June 27, 2026 — Migration 044: temporarily WIDEN fair-price bounds for testing

**Task:** Allow any reasonable test quote to pass during testing WITHOUT disabling the fair-price validation, then correct stale docs and enrich the deferred backlog.

**Confirmed formula (read from `submit_quote_atomic`, migration `039_security_backstop.sql:262-274`):**
- `v_min_fair = base_fee + (distance_km × min_price_per_km)`
- `v_max_fair = base_fee + (distance_km × max_price_per_km)`
- reject `price_too_low` if `proposed_price < v_min_fair`; reject `price_too_high` if `proposed_price > v_max_fair`.
- `distance_km` is the single leg provider→customer (route-side haversine). The route (`provider/jobs/quote/route.ts`) has no independent price check — the RPC is the sole enforcement point; `range-estimator.ts` is UI-only.

**Change — migration `044_temp_widen_fair_price_bounds.sql` (created, NOT applied by me):**
- `UPDATE public.fair_price_config SET min_price_per_km = 0.01, max_price_per_km = 10000, updated_at = now();` for ALL service types. `base_fee` left unchanged. Idempotent (absolute values). Includes before/after snapshot SELECT comments and a `DO $$` block that raises if any row was not widened.
- WIDENS, does NOT disable: the RPC logic is untouched and still runs the range check on every quote. Amounts below the base_fee floor are still correctly rejected `price_too_low` (expected).
- Header documents this as TEMPORARY test scaffolding and a LAUNCH BLOCKER to REDESIGN (two-leg distance: provider→breakdown + breakdown→destination, mandatory 7-emirate dropdown) — NOT a restore target. References backlog P9/P1/P2. Previous seeded values listed for the record only: tow 3–8/100, battery 2–5/80, flat_tire 2–5/60, fuel 2–5/50, lockout 2–6/70, other 2–6/80.

**Stale-doc corrections (fair-price enforcement was: disabled by 032 → RE-ENABLED by 039 (Batch 1) → TEMPORARILY WIDENED by 044; redesign before launch, not restore):**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (3 lines: config note, deployment-state note, known-gap note)
- `MARKETPLACE_V2_SPEC.md` (1 line: the 032-disables claim)
- `RESCUEGO_MASTER_REFERENCE.md` (5 lines: file-tree note, `fair_price_config` table doc, RPC table row, quote-flow note, "known issue" item — plus the C5 findings-table row annotated with the 044 widen + launch-blocker note)
- Deliberately LEFT UNCHANGED: `SECURITY_AUDIT_1/2/3.md` — these are point-in-time audit records that correctly describe the 032 state at the time of each audit; they are historical, not stale.

**Backlog:** Saved the owner's authoritative `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` (items P1–P10) into the repo root, keeping P1–P8 and P10 verbatim; only P9 was enriched (confirmed formula, migration 044 reference, widened values 0.01/10000, base_fee unchanged, two-leg+emirate redesign launch-blocker, QA scenarios) and its status set to "DONE (widen migration created) — redesign still OPEN".

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` (SQL + markdown changes only; no TS touched).

**Deploy:** apply `044` by pasting it into the Supabase SQL editor and running it (production DB). No code deploy required for the widening itself.

---

## Session: June 27, 2026 — PPJ free-accept bypass fix (server-side payment guard)

**Finding:** A Pay Per Job (PPJ) provider could be assigned a job WITHOUT paying the per-job acceptance fee. The free accept route `src/app/api/provider/requests/accept/route.ts` had no PPJ-plan guard: its checks were role/active/online/no-active-job, and the overage guard deliberately skips PPJ (`hasMonthlyAllowance=false`). It then called `accept_provider_request_atomic` directly and assigned the job. The atomic RPC itself does not gate PPJ payment (migrations 011/015/024 — PPJ logic there is only `p_consume_ppj_credit` and `p_plan_limit`), so PPJ payment enforcement is entirely the caller's responsibility. The UI (`ProviderRequestList.tsx:117`) correctly routes PPJ to `/api/provider/ppj-checkout`, but the server had no defense-in-depth, so any stale/alternate client or direct call to the accept route bypassed payment. The PPJ payment chain (ppj-checkout → PaymentIntent → webhook `finalizeAcceptedRequest`) was intact and NOT disabled; Stripe (test keys) and subscription checkout were working.

**Fix (code-only, minimal, one file):** Added a server-side guard in `accept/route.ts` immediately after the active-status check — when `provider.plan === 'pay_per_job'`, log `accept_request_blocked_ppj_payment_required` and return `403 { error, code: 'PPJ_PAYMENT_REQUIRED', request_id }`. PPJ never legitimately uses this route, so the subscription/overage path is untouched. No changes to subscription checkout, Stripe webhook, ppj-checkout route, database, migrations, or launch behavior.

**Fee amount (env-only, NOT changed in code — to be set by operator):** PPJ test fee is currently 30/70 AED by distance because `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO` is unset. To use the 15 AED promo fee in test, set in Vercel + `.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO=true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PPJ_PROMO_FEE_AED=15`. Stays on Stripe TEST keys; no live impact.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run lint` exit 0, `npm run build` exit 0.

---

## Session: June 27, 2026 — Security Remediation Batch 4 (rate limiting, GET hardening, lib hardening, index)

Last active security batch (Batch 5 is deferred/architectural). 7 files; one DB change in new migration 043.

**Findings closed:**
- **P4-H1** (`src/app/api/requests/route.ts`) — added `checkRateLimitAsync('customer-active-request:'+user.id, 60, 60_000, 'customer_get_active_request')` (SOFT) to the GET handler; 429 + Retry-After. The quotes GET was already rate-limited (60/min) and is kept at 60/min per ruling (not lowered to the audit's suggested 30/min — already deployed, safe for active polling).
- **HIGH-02** (`src/app/api/requests/route.ts`) — removed the state-mutating expiry write (former lines 136-149). GET is now read-only: a `quoted` request older than 20 min is treated as expired in the response only (`activeRequest = null`), no DB write. `marketplace-cron` owns DB expiry. Confirmed safe — writes are server-authoritative: `select_quote_atomic` (`customer/quote/select/route.ts:52-56`) re-validates live DB state and rejects with `request_not_in_quoted_status`/`quote_expired`, so the brief read-vs-DB mismatch cannot cause an inconsistent write. Response shape unchanged.
- **HIGH-01** (`src/app/api/requests/quotes/route.ts`) — `request_id` is validated as a UUID (`z.string().uuid()`) before any DB call; missing/malformed input returns a uniform `400 { error: 'Invalid request' }`. No DB-level error reaches malformed input, removing the info-leak distinguishability.
- **M1 (fully closed)** (`src/app/api/admin/sentry-verify/route.ts`) — added `checkRateLimitAsync('admin-sentry-verify:'+user.id, 30, 60_000, 'admin_sentry_verify')` (SOFT) after the admin role check, matching Batch 3's `admin/providers/update`. No admin route now lacks rate limiting.
- **P4-M4 / H4** (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`) — replaced the lifetime-of-instance `redisFallbackLogged` boolean with a 60s time-throttled timestamp (`lastFallbackLogAt` + `FALLBACK_LOG_THROTTLE_MS`) so a degraded fleet stays visible instead of silently logging once. Added `RateLimitMode = 'soft' | 'hard'`: SOFT (default) keeps in-memory fallback; HARD fails closed (deny) when Redis is unavailable and logs `rate_limit_redis_unavailable_hard_fail`.
- **P4-M6** (`src/lib/ops-auth.ts`) — Vercel's `CRON_SECRET` is honored only if ≥32 chars (else ignored + `ops_route_weak_cron_secret` warning); both secret comparisons now use constant-time `timingSafeEqual` (closes the timing side-channel). Fail-closed behavior preserved (missing OPS secret → 503, wrong → 401).
- **P4-L4** (`src/lib/env.ts`) — `OPS_CRON_SECRET` is now a production-only hard-fail in `validateEnv()` (throws at startup if missing in production), eliminating silent runtime 503s. NOT required in development (cron not exercised locally) → dev startup unaffected. Existing ≥32-char check retained.
- **P4-M1** (`supabase/migrations/043_jobs_en_route_at_index.sql`, new) — partial index `idx_jobs_en_route_at_active ON public.jobs (en_route_at) WHERE completed_at IS NULL`, matching the admin stuck-job query (`admin/dashboard/page.tsx:80-85`). Columns verified against `025_provider_state_machine.sql:19-21` (not phantom). Idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`). **CODE COMPLETE — NEEDS RUNTIME VERIFICATION** until applied.

**Rate-limit helper signature change:** `checkRateLimitAsync` gains an optional 5th param `mode: RateLimitMode = 'soft'`. All 20 existing callers use the 4-arg form → fully backward compatible (tsc/lint/build pass). HARD mode is capability-only this batch — **NOT wired into any payment route** (deferred to a payment verification pass).

**Decisions stated:** quotes route kept at 60/min (ruling); env.ts = production-only hard requirement; GET rate limits = 60/min (requests), 60/min (quotes, pre-existing), 30/min (sentry-verify).

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run lint` exit 0, `npm run build` exit 0.

**Migration baseline:** 001-042 deployed + runtime-verified; 043 CODE COMPLETE — NEEDS RUNTIME VERIFICATION. Next = 044.

## Session: June 26, 2026 — Batch 3 Runtime Hotfix (CRIT-02 cron phantom column)

**Runtime finding:** Calling `GET /api/ops/marketplace-cron` returned
`{ "success": false, "errors": ["sla_fetch: column requests.updated_at does not exist"], "sla_releases": 0 }`.
The SLA release path threw on every run and never executed.

**Root cause:** `enforceSla()` ordered the candidate query by `requests.updated_at`, which does not
exist on the `requests` table. Verified against the schema: `requests` (`001_initial_schema.sql:32-45`)
has `created_at` only; `accepted_at`/`quoted_at` were added in `031`; no migration ever adds
`updated_at` to `requests`. The earlier `updated_at` assumption was a phantom column.

**Fix (single file, no business-logic change):** `src/app/api/ops/marketplace-cron/route.ts` —
`enforceSla()` candidate query now orders by `requests.created_at` ascending (oldest-first) instead of
`updated_at`. Chosen over a `jobs` join on `COALESCE(arrived_at, en_route_at, accepted_at)` because
`created_at` is verified to exist, is monotonic, and accepted requests may have no `jobs` row yet
(making the COALESCE order fragile). Oldest-first still guarantees long-lived (most-likely-breached)
requests are examined before fresh ones, so `LIMIT 50` cannot starve a genuine breach. The CRIT-02
design is unchanged: the cron fetches `accepted`/`en_route`/`arrived` candidates and delegates ALL
threshold/release decisions to `sla_check_and_release`.

**Related risk — NOW FIXED in migration 042:** the same phantom `requests.updated_at` was referenced
inside `expire_stuck_active_requests` at `028:105` and `040:340` (`r.updated_at`) — the weekly stuck-
request cleanup RPC would throw `column requests.updated_at does not exist` at runtime and never run.
Fixed via new migration `042_fix_expire_stuck_phantom_column.sql`: `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
expire_stuck_active_requests(...)` superseding the deployed RPC, with the single line `r.updated_at`
→ `r.created_at`. Deployed migrations 028/040 are NOT edited. Signature `(p_stuck_cutoff TIMESTAMPTZ)
RETURNS INTEGER`, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `SET search_path = public`, and the REVOKE(anon,authenticated)
/ GRANT(service_role) pattern are all preserved. ALL Batch 2 / LOW-03 logic preserved verbatim
(jobs_this_month decrement only when `selected_quote_id` slot consumed, `GREATEST(0, ..-1)` no-double-
decrement guard, full release cleanup). Executable-SQL check: 1 function, 0 `r.updated_at`, 1
`r.created_at`, both LOW-03 guards present.

**Project-wide `updated_at` audit (every match classified):** the ONLY `updated_at` references that
bind to the `requests` table were the two phantom ones above (`028`/`040`, alias `r` = `FROM requests`),
now fixed. All other matches are legitimate columns on OTHER tables and were left untouched:
`provider_locations.updated_at` (`001:29`, plus the `pl.updated_at` staleness filters in
`002/004/010/018/033/035/039`), `fair_price_config.updated_at` (`031:178`), `stripe_events.updated_at`
(`013` indexes; `admin/dashboard` order), `billing/overage_payments.updated_at` (`006`), and the
`provider_locations`/route `updated_at` reads-writes in `provider/location`, `quote`, `accept`,
`overage-checkout`, `ppj-checkout`, `webhook`, `expire-requests`, `provider/dashboard`, and
`src/types/database.ts`. No remaining phantom `requests.updated_at` anywhere in src or migrations.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run lint` exit 0, `npm run build` exit 0.
CRIT-02 remains **CODE COMPLETE — NOT runtime-verified** until this fix is deployed and the cron test
returns `success` with `sla_releases >= 1` on a prepared `arrived`/`en_route` breach request.

## Session: June 26, 2026 — Security Remediation Batch 3 (shared ops/admin files)

### Summary
Closed the remaining findings that live in three shared ops/admin files, plus one new migration. **CRIT-02 is now FULLY closed** (the migration-040 RPC side shipped in Batch 2; this session shipped the cron side). Also closed P4-C2, P4-H2, P4-H4, P4-M2 (SECURITY_AUDIT_4), F3-L4 (SECURITY_AUDIT_3), and H5 + M1 (SECURITY_AUDIT_1). Each file was opened once and received all its changes. `admin/providers/update` is the only admin route touched; V2 overage enforcement remains deferred.

### Files modified
- **`src/app/api/ops/marketplace-cron/route.ts`**
  - **CRIT-02 (cron side):** `enforceSla()` now selects candidates with `status IN ('accepted','en_route','arrived')`, ordered `updated_at` ascending (oldest-first) before `LIMIT 50`, and calls `sla_check_and_release(id)` per row. The RPC remains the single source of truth for the 20m/2h/60m thresholds and the quoted-vs-open decision — no threshold math in the route. The old `accepted_at` cutoff filter was removed (it can't gate en_route/arrived, whose timestamps live on `jobs`).
  - **P4-H2:** candidates capped at `SLA_CANDIDATE_LIMIT = 50`, processed sequentially within `maxDuration`. Oldest-first ordering guarantees the closest-to-breach rows are never starved; if >50 candidates exist in one minute, the remainder is handled by subsequent minute runs.
  - **P4-M2:** `EXPIRE_BATCH_LIMIT = 500` added as `.limit(500)` to both `expireStaleQuotes` and `expireUnselectedRequests`.
  - **P4-H4:** the route returns **HTTP 500** when any critical subtask (a whole query/RPC-fetch that errors or throws) fails, so Vercel retries and alerting fires. Normal per-row outcomes (e.g. `sla_not_breached`) are not failures — logged and skipped.
- **`src/app/api/ops/monthly-allowance-reset/route.ts`**
  - **P4-C2:** unbounded load + `Promise.all` replaced with `.range()` pagination in pages of `PAGE_SIZE = 50` (ordered by id), processed page-by-page; memory stays flat.
  - **F3-L4:** query widened to `plan IN ('starter','pro','business')`. Business resets on the same monthly Stripe-period cadence and zeroes **only `jobs_this_month`** (+ advances `jobs_reset_at`); it never touches `job_credit_balance` or any billing/allowance field. starter/pro behavior unchanged.
  - Each reset UPDATE carries its eligibility in the WHERE clause (id, plan, `stripe_current_period_start`, `jobs_reset_at`), so pagination drift or a retry can never reset an ineligible/already-reset provider. P4-H4: 500 on load failure or any per-provider failure.
- **`supabase/migrations/041_admin_provider_status_atomic.sql`** (new, idempotent)
  - **H5:** `admin_update_provider_status_atomic(p_admin_id, p_provider_id, p_new_status, p_verified_badge, p_review_notes, p_previous_status, p_action)` — SECURITY DEFINER, `SET search_path = public`, revoke anon/authenticated + grant service_role. Validates status/action against the CHECK allow-lists; `COALESCE`-updates ONLY `status`/`verified_badge`; inserts one `provider_kyc_log` row when status changed — all in one transaction. Narrow named params only, so it is not a generic provider-update bypass and preserves the C3 immutable-column protection from migration 039.
- **`src/app/api/admin/providers/update/route.ts`**
  - **H5:** the two separate writes (provider update + audit-log insert) replaced with a single call to `admin_update_provider_status_atomic`. All existing validations (auth, admin role, target lookup, provider-role mismatch, no-updates guard) preserved; the route maps status→action and passes the previous status.
  - **M1:** `checkRateLimitAsync('admin-provider-update:'+user.id, 30, 60000, 'admin_provider_update')` added after the admin-role check; 429 + Retry-After when exceeded.
- **`RESCUEGO_MASTER_REFERENCE.md`** / **`SESSION_LOG.md`** — finding statuses, migration baseline (next = 042), Batch 3 deployment note, and §6.3 post-deploy verification plan.

### Decisions
- **Business reset cadence = monthly** (aligned with starter/pro via `stripe_current_period_start > jobs_reset_at`), not daily. Business subscribes via Stripe so it has a billing period; monthly keeps the admin dashboard "jobs this month" figure meaningful and the operation idempotent. Verified (code evidence) that no path gates a business provider on `jobs_this_month` (`provider-allowance.ts` returns null/unlimited for business; `accept_provider_request_atomic` is passed `-1`), so zeroing it is data-integrity only.
- **No double-decrement under cron retry (P4-H4 idempotency):**
  - `sla_check_and_release` re-selects the request `FOR UPDATE` and returns early (`not_in_releasable_status` / `sla_not_breached`) if the row is no longer in `accepted/en_route/arrived`; an already-released request is never decremented again.
  - `expireStaleQuotes` / `expireUnselectedRequests` are status-guarded UPDATEs (`.eq('status', …)`); a retry matches zero already-expired rows.
  - `monthly-allowance-reset` enforces eligibility in the UPDATE WHERE clause and advances `jobs_reset_at`, so a retry resets nothing twice.

### Discrepancies vs reports
None. `providers.status` is TEXT with a CHECK allow-list; `provider_kyc_log` columns matched the audit. No phantom columns.

### Pending / follow-up
- **CRIT-02 post-deploy QA (re-run required):** leave a job in `en_route` past 2h or `arrived` past 60m → the minute cron must auto-release it to `quoted`/`open` per D6. This could not pass before this batch. See `RESCUEGO_MASTER_REFERENCE.md` §6.3.
- **M1 follow-up:** `src/app/api/admin/sentry-verify/route.ts` still needs `checkRateLimitAsync` (only other admin route lacking it).
- Migration 041 RPC is **CODE COMPLETE — NEEDS RUNTIME VERIFICATION** until 041 is deployed.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.

## Session: July 8, 2026 — API phase: mandatory GPS, snapshot population, Dubai fallback removal (tiered dispatch activation)

Read-only design first (previous entry), approved with Q1/Q2 resolutions, then implemented. Code-only — no new migration.

### What changed
- **`src/app/api/requests/route.ts`:** `coords` is now a required field in the request schema (was optional/nullable); a missing/invalid-range `coords` returns `422 { error, code: 'coordinates_required' }` distinctly from other validation failures (still `400`). The fixed `POINT(55.2708 25.2048)` Dubai-center fallback and the matching `fuzzy` null-fallback are removed — both are now unconditional since coordinates are guaranteed present. `location_address` is now optional (R6: address is a descriptive note only). Added a new `accuracy` optional field, recorded in the `request_created` log event as `gps_accuracy_meters` — never used for gating (Q1).
- **Snapshot population:** `providers_in_range_at_creation`/`subscribers_in_range_at_creation` are now populated on every insert. Implementation note: Supabase's PostgREST query builder cannot express `ST_DWithin` or `COUNT ... FILTER` directly, and no new migration/RPC was authorized this phase. The binding single-statement constraint (`TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` §5) is satisfied with ONE `.select('lat, lng, providers!inner(plan, status)')` round-trip against `provider_locations` (using its existing generated `lat`/`lng` columns from migration 036), filtered to `providers.status = 'active'` and GPS updated within 5 minutes — the 150km radius check and both count aggregations are then computed in application code via the existing `distanceMeters()` helper from `src/lib/geo.ts`. One query, no race window between two separate `SELECT`s. Runs via the admin (service-role) client — mandatory, not the user-context client, since a customer session cannot read other providers' rows under RLS. If the query fails, both snapshot columns are left `NULL` and the failure is logged as `snapshot_count_failed` — request creation still succeeds. This NULL fallback is INTENTIONAL (falls to the pre-tiered "visible to all" legacy path via migration 053's `COALESCE`) and must never be treated as a bug to fix.
- **`src/app/customer/request/page.tsx`:** GPS is now required to reach step 3 (the "Continue" button is disabled without `coords`, not `address`). `handleSubmit`'s validation now checks `coords` separately from `problemType`/`phone`, showing a dedicated `locationRequiredHint` message. The address field is fully decoupled from GPS: `handleAddressChange` no longer clears `coords` on edit (the superseded "manual-source bypass" — dead code removed, not reused), and a successful GPS fix no longer overwrites the address field with a placeholder string. The permission-denied handler no longer auto-focuses the address input (manual address can no longer substitute for GPS). A new `gpsAccuracy` state records `pos.coords.accuracy` (Q1: recorded, never gates). Step-3's summary falls back to a `gpsLocationConfirmed` message when the optional address note is empty.
- **i18n (`messages/en.json` + `messages/ar.json`):** modified `addressLabel`, `addressPlaceholder`, `locationNotSupported`, `locationDenied`, `locationFailed` to reflect GPS-mandatory / address-is-optional-note copy; added new keys `locationRequiredHint`, `gpsLocationConfirmed`. `manualLocation` is left in place, unused (harmless, not deleted).
- **Q2 (in-flight requests at deploy):** no special handling — a form opened pre-deploy and submitted post-deploy without coordinates gets the `coordinates_required` error with the existing retry path, which is the intended behavior.
- **`destination_emirate`:** left unpopulated — out of scope; the form has no destination-coordinate capture to derive it from (separate future form-phase item).

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- `npm run lint` — exit 0.

### Files changed
- `src/app/api/requests/route.ts`
- `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx`
- `messages/en.json`
- `messages/ar.json`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — new "API phase (tiered dispatch activation)" status row, CODE COMPLETE — awaiting deploy
- `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` — §5 API-phase note marked IMPLEMENTED, records Q1/Q2, the dual-count implementation approach, the intentional NULL count-failure fallback, and the manual-source-bypass supersession
- `npm run lint` — exit 0 (removed an unused param to keep it clean).
- `npm run build` — succeeded; full route manifest emitted (including the changed ops/admin routes).

## Session: June 25, 2026 — Security Remediation Batch 2 (RPC integrity & state-machine safety)

### Summary
Closed the RPC-integrity and state-machine findings from SECURITY_AUDIT_2 (CRIT-01, CRIT-02, HIGH-03, HIGH-04, HIGH-05, HIGH-06, MED-04, LOW-01, LOW-03, LOW-04), SECURITY_AUDIT_3 (F3-H2), and SECURITY_AUDIT_1 (H1). All DB changes are in one new idempotent migration, `040_rpc_integrity_state_safety.sql` (one block per RPC). No deployed migration was edited. Four API routes were updated to call the new/changed RPCs and drop racy or leaky logic. `admin/providers/update` (H5) and V2 overage enforcement (H3/D5) were deliberately left untouched per Batch scope.

### Schema verification (done before writing SQL)
- `requests.accepted_at` (031), `selected_quote_id` (031), `overage_cleared` (005), `price_change_requested`/`_status`/`_count` (031) — all exist.
- `jobs.en_route_at` and `jobs.arrived_at` (025) — confirmed to exist; used for en_route/arrived SLA breach timing.
- `ratings.customer_id` — confirmed absent; added in this migration.

### Migration 040 — `supabase/migrations/040_rpc_integrity_state_safety.sql` (new, idempotent)
- **2.1 helper `release_target_status(request_id)`** — read-only `STABLE` function; returns `'quoted'` if a quote with `status='pending' AND expires_at > now()` exists, else `'open'`. Mutates nothing. Shared by both release paths (D6).
- **2.3 `release_job_atomic` (HIGH-03 + MED-04 + F3-H2)** — single block; preserves `(success, reason)` return. Now sets status via `release_target_status()`, clears `selected_quote_id`/`accepted_at`, sets `overage_cleared=false`, and decrements `jobs_this_month` (`GREATEST(0, .. - 1)`) only when `selected_quote_id` was present before release (V2 slot consumed; captured beforehand).
- **2.2 `sla_check_and_release` (CRIT-02 + HIGH-04)** — single block; preserves `(success, reason, released_provider_id, needs_refund)` return. Now releases from `accepted`/`en_route`/`arrived`. Breach computed inside the RPC with named-constant thresholds: **accepted = 20 minutes** (vs `requests.accepted_at`), **en_route = 2 hours** (vs `jobs.en_route_at`), **arrived = 60 minutes** (vs `jobs.arrived_at`). Sets status via the shared helper, clears `accepted_by`/`selected_quote_id`/`accepted_at`/`overage_cleared`, decrements `jobs_this_month` only when a slot was consumed (HIGH-04, no double-decrement).
- **2.4 `expire_stuck_active_requests` (LOW-03)** — single block; preserves `RETURNS INTEGER` + `(p_stuck_cutoff TIMESTAMPTZ)`. Per-row decrement of `jobs_this_month` (`GREATEST(0, .. - 1)`) only when the released request had `selected_quote_id` set.
- **2.5 `advance_provider_job_state` (LOW-01 + LOW-04)** — single block; added `SET search_path = public` and a whitelist rejecting any `p_to_status` outside `('en_route','arrived','in_progress')` (`invalid_target_status`).
- **2.6 `request_price_change_atomic` (CRIT-01)** — new RPC; single guarded `UPDATE ... WHERE accepted_by=<prov> AND status='in_progress' AND price_change_count=0 RETURNING id`. Eliminates the read-then-write race.
- **2.7 `respond_price_change_atomic` (HIGH-06)** — new RPC; guard `status='in_progress' AND price_change_status='pending'` inside the RPC. Reject → `final_price=NULL` (never surfaces the requested price); approve → `final_price=price_change_requested`. `price_change_count` untouched (stays 1; no second attempt).
- **2.8 `ratings.customer_id` (HIGH-05)** — `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)` + index + deterministic backfill via `jobs → requests` (job_id is UNIQUE so each rating maps to exactly one customer).
- **2.9 `select_quote_atomic` (H1)** — single block; `provider_documents JSONB` removed from `RETURNS TABLE` and from the `RETURN QUERY` (6 → 5 columns). Customer still gets name/phone/rating.
- All RPCs keep `SECURITY DEFINER`, `SET search_path = public`, and the revoke-from-anon/authenticated + grant-to-service_role pattern.

### Routes updated
- `src/app/api/provider/jobs/price-change/route.ts` (CRIT-01) — removed the pre-fetch + manual count/status checks + racy `.update()`; now calls `request_price_change_atomic`; maps `price_change_not_allowed` → 409.
- `src/app/api/customer/price-change/respond/route.ts` (HIGH-06) — removed the pre-fetch guards + racy `.update()`; now calls `respond_price_change_atomic`; uses returned `final_price`.
- `src/app/api/ratings/route.ts` (HIGH-05) — writes `customer_id: user.id` on insert (route already verifies the job's request belongs to this customer).
- `src/app/api/customer/quote/select/route.ts` (H1) — dropped `provider_documents` from the result type and stopped returning `documents`; keeps name/phone/rating. Verified no client consumes `documents` from this response.

### Backfill decision (ratings.customer_id)
Backfill existing rows. `ratings.job_id` is UNIQUE (migration 022) and each job maps to exactly one request, so the customer is unambiguous — there is no fan-out or duplicate mapping. The backfill UPDATE only sets rows where the joined `requests.customer_id` is non-null; any rating whose job/request cannot be resolved is left null and populated going forward. Post-deploy check in §6.2-H must return 0.

### Discrepancies vs reports
None. All columns the audits referenced exist as described; `ratings.customer_id` was genuinely missing (matches HIGH-05). No phantom columns encountered.

### Pending in Batch 3 (noted, not done here)
- **CRIT-02 cron routing:** `enforceSla()` in `src/app/api/ops/marketplace-cron/route.ts:115–121` still queries `status='accepted'` only. It must be widened to `status IN ('accepted','en_route','arrived')` (and compute the cutoff per state) so the now-extended `sla_check_and_release` actually receives `en_route`/`arrived` breaches. The RPC side is ready.
- H5 (`admin/providers/update`) and H3/D5 (V2 overage enforcement) intentionally deferred.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0, no output.
- `npm run lint` — exit 0, no errors/warnings.
- `npm run build` — succeeded; full route manifest emitted (including `/api/provider/jobs/price-change`, `/api/ratings`).
- All migration-040 RPC changes are **CODE COMPLETE — NEEDS RUNTIME VERIFICATION** until 040 is deployed; post-deploy SQL is in `RESCUEGO_MASTER_REFERENCE.md` §6.2.

---

## Session: June 24, 2026 — Security Remediation Batch 1 (existential fixes)

### Summary
Closed the existential security findings from SECURITY_AUDIT_1 and SECURITY_AUDIT_3 across the database, the Stripe webhook, the subscription checkout route, the request proxy, and request-user auth. One audit finding (C1) was found to be based on outdated Next.js knowledge and was intentionally NOT applied — see "Decision required" below.

### Migration 039 — `supabase/migrations/039_security_backstop.sql` (new, idempotent)
- **C2** — `enforce_users_immutable_columns()` `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `users`: blocks any change to `role` unless the caller is admin or genuine service_role. Prevents self-escalation to admin.
- **C3** — `enforce_providers_immutable_columns()` `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `providers`: locks `status, verified_badge, rating, plan, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, stripe_current_period_start, stripe_current_period_end, jobs_this_month, jobs_reset_at, visibility_reduced, sla_failure_count, job_credit_balance, ppj_recovery_credits, release_count, provider_side_cancellation_count, unable_to_complete_count, last_upgrade_bonus_key, documents`. Prevents provider self-activation, plan changes, and billing/KYC tampering. (`max_active_jobs` and `completed_jobs_count` deliberately excluded — they do not exist on the table.)
- **Server-side guard** — new `is_service_role()` helper inspects the JWT `role` claim (`request.jwt.claims`). The triggers use `is_admin() OR is_service_role()`, so admin/server (service_role) writes pass while anon and authenticated browser writes are blocked. `auth.uid() IS NULL` was rejected as too weak because the anon role also has a null uid.
- **C5 (D2)** — `submit_quote_atomic` re-enables fair-price validation. Bounds are read exclusively from `fair_price_config` (no hard-coded prices); out-of-range quotes are rejected as `price_too_low` / `price_too_high`. Fallback: missing service-type row uses the `'other'` config row; if no config exists at all, range check is skipped (validity-only) to avoid blocking honest providers on an ops misconfiguration.
- **D8** — `get_nearby_open_requests` recreated with `fuzzy_latitude` and `fuzzy_longitude` added to the return (all existing columns, including `destination` and `destination_area`, preserved). Fixes the emirate/area badge on the primary RPC path.
- **F3-H1 schema** — `overage_payments.accept_failed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` + partial index for manual-review tracking.
- All modified RPCs keep `SECURITY DEFINER`, `SET search_path = public`, and the existing `service_role` grant.

### `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- **C4 / F3-C1 (D1)** — `KYC_PROTECTED` extended to `['pending','under_review','rejected','suspended']` and checked before the `active` branch, so a payment never auto-activates a provider; activation waits for admin. Subscription details (plan, stripe ids, billing period) are still recorded.
- **F3-H1** — on a failed overage accept, `overage_payments.accept_failed` is set and the event is logged for admin follow-up; `overage_cleared` is now set only after a successful accept. No automatic refund.
- **F3-M1** — an active subscription whose plan cannot be resolved now logs (with subscription id and unmatched price ids) and throws so the event is recorded failed, instead of silently writing an unresolved plan.
- **F3-M2 / M4** — `claimStripeEvent` is now atomic (conflict-aware upsert + status-guarded conditional re-claim), removing the TOCTOU window.
- **F3-L1** — `payment_intent.canceled` handled; only currently-`pending` PPJ/overage rows move to `failed` (never touches paid/succeeded/`accept_failed`).
- **L4** — `PROCESSING_TIMEOUT_MS` reduced from 10 minutes to 3 minutes.

### `src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout/route.ts`
- **M3 / F3-M3 (D1)** — KYC status gate: `rejected` and `suspended` providers get 403 before both the checkout and billing-portal branches; `pending`/`under_review`/`active` may proceed.

### `src/proxy.ts` + `src/lib/supabase/request-user.ts`
- **H7** — CSRF: a state-mutating `/api/` POST with neither Origin nor Referer is now rejected (was silently skipped).
- **D9** — removed the `*.vercel.app` wildcard; only enumerated `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (plus the request's own host) are accepted.
- **D10** — removed the Bearer-token fallback from `getRequestUser`; auth is cookie-session only. The four callers were updated to call `getRequestUser()`. Cron/ops routes use `OPS_CRON_SECRET`, so they are unaffected.

### Decision required — C1 (proxy vs middleware)
The audit asked to convert `src/proxy.ts` to `src/middleware.ts` with `export default middleware`. The bundled Next.js 16.2.6 docs (`node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/proxy.md`) show that in v16.0.0 the `middleware` convention was **deprecated and renamed to `proxy`**; the official codemod renames `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` (the opposite direction). The current `src/proxy.ts` with a named `proxy` export is the correct, registered convention — the production build confirms it as `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`. The rename was therefore NOT performed. Awaiting a ruling.

### Admin activation path check (read-only)
`src/app/api/admin/providers/update/route.ts` accepts a `status` of `active` (validation schema), assigns it, and writes via the admin client. A manual admin activation path (`pending`/`under_review` → `active`) **EXISTS**. D1 is complete on the admin side.

### Verification (static)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- `npm run lint` (eslint) — 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `npm run build` — exit 0; proxy registered as `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`.

### C1 ruling (confirmed)
C1 recorded as **Not Applicable on Next.js 16**: `middleware` was deprecated and renamed to `proxy` in v16.0.0. `src/proxy.ts` is the active registered middleware/proxy entrypoint (build confirms `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`). No open vulnerability remains.

### Runtime verification of C2/C3 — ATTEMPTED, BLOCKED (not yet verified)
- Probed the cloud DB read-only with the service-role key (introspection only, not a substitute test): `public.is_service_role()` → **PGRST202 "function not found"**, `overage_payments.accept_failed` → **42703 "column does not exist"**. Conclusion: **migration 039 is NOT applied to the cloud database yet.**
- This environment has **no `supabase` CLI, no `psql`, no `docker`, no local Supabase stack, and no direct `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL`** — so 039 cannot be applied locally and the anon/authenticated attacker-context UPDATEs cannot be executed here.
- Per the explicit instruction, no `service_role` test or code-logic review was substituted as "runtime-verified." The C2/C3 (and the migration-dependent) findings are marked **CODE COMPLETE — NEEDS RUNTIME VERIFICATION**.
- Exact verification steps (psql `SET request.jwt.claims` + Supabase anon JS) are documented in `RESCUEGO_MASTER_REFERENCE.md` §6.1 to run after 039 deploys. Pass criteria: tests 1 & 2 return SQLSTATE `42501`; test 3 (service_role/admin) succeeds.

### Documentation corrections
- `RESCUEGO_MASTER_REFERENCE.md` providers schema: `max_active_jobs` and `completed_jobs_count` corrected to **do NOT exist** on the `providers` table (verified against full migration history; the plan concurrency cap is derived from `plan` at runtime).
- Marked **NEEDS RUNTIME VERIFICATION**: CSRF hardening (H7/D9), Stripe webhook behavior (C4/F3-C1, M4/F3-M2, F3-M1, F3-L1), and production payment-path validation (M3/F3-M3).

### Batch 1 close-out
Static verification passed. The only remaining gate is the post-deploy runtime check of the 039 triggers (§6.1). Once 039 is applied and §6.1 passes, Batch 1 is fully closed.

## Session: June 11, 2026 — Documentation Refresh From Source

### Summary
Refreshed the primary project documentation from the current codebase without touching source code. The goal was to make the docs usable as a current handoff for a fresh AI agent.

### Documentation Updated

| File | Update |
|------|--------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Created canonical current-state architecture, database/storage/KYC/payment map, and `OBSERVATIONS FOR AUDIT` section |
| `README.md` | Replaced stale Phase 1A and migration 016 claims with current stack, migration, and documentation map |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Rewritten as current AI-agent project notes |
| `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` | Rewritten as concise current handoff |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Updated to reflect completed Marketplace V2, KYC, payment, ops, and production-hardening work |
| `MARKETPLACE_V2_SPEC.md` | Updated from future/planning language to implemented behavior and current caveats |

### Source Review Scope
Read project configuration, migrations, API routes, app surfaces, components, lib utilities, shared types, i18n files, and existing markdown docs to align documentation with implementation.

### Notes
No source files were modified. Observed implementation concerns were documented only in `ARCHITECTURE.md` under `OBSERVATIONS FOR AUDIT`.

## Session: June 10, 2026 — Lifecycle Bugfixes + Distance Fix + Lint Clean

### Summary
Three focused bug-fix sessions addressing critical lifecycle issues in the provider/customer request flow, distance display on provider request cards, and a full lint pass to zero errors.

### Changes

#### Part 1 — Lifecycle & Realtime Bugfixes (commits: ccb1b65, 3ee45e6)

| Category | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Provider 429 errors | `ProviderRealtimeRefresh`: single shared `supabase` client via `useRef(createClient())`; debounce raised from 800ms → 1500ms; added 3s global throttle so `router.refresh()` fires at most once per 3s regardless of event volume |
| Provider duplicate refresh | `ProviderRequestList`: removed redundant `visibility`/`online` event handlers (handled by `ProviderRealtimeRefresh`) |
| Provider 429 on quote | `ProviderQuoteForm`: handle HTTP 429 explicitly with user-facing `tooManyAttempts` message instead of crashing |
| Customer stale cancel dialog | Added `justCancelledRef` guard — blocks all fetch/polling/realtime for 3s after cancel to prevent stale server state from re-setting `activeRequest` |
| Concurrent fetch prevention | Added `fetchInFlightRef` to `loadRequestState()` — prevents parallel fetches racing each other |
| Submit button disabled after cancel | `resetForm()` now correctly clears `requestId`; `handleSubmit()` clears `justCancelledRef` to re-enable polling for new request |
| Customer polling after cancel | Polling/realtime/visibility effects all guard on `justCancelledRef.current` |
| CustomerQuoteList debounce | Added 1s debounce + in-flight guard to prevent rapid duplicate fetches on realtime events |

#### Part 2 — Distance Display Fix (commits: 3ee45e6, d6a1296)

| Category | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Root cause 1: WKB hex | Supabase REST returns `GEOMETRY(Point,4326)` columns as hex WKB, not GeoJSON. `location.coordinates` was always `undefined` in JS |
| Root cause 2: fallback no coords | Fallback query never fetched `fuzzy_latitude`/`fuzzy_longitude` so Haversine couldn't compute distance |
| Root cause 3: fuzzy not propagated | `NearbyOpenRequestRow` type didn't include fuzzy coords, so `ProviderRequestList` never received them |
| Fix: migration 036 | Added `lat`/`lng` as `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (ST_X/ST_Y)` columns on `provider_locations` — plain `float8`, no parsing needed |
| Fix: fallback query | Now selects `fuzzy_latitude, fuzzy_longitude` and computes `distanceKm()` server-side |
| Fix: type propagation | `NearbyOpenRequestRow` now includes optional `fuzzy_latitude/fuzzy_longitude`; normalization explicitly carries them through |
| No-GPS requests | When `fuzzy_latitude` is null (address-only request), shows "بدون إحداثيات GPS" instead of generic distance label |

#### Part 3 — Lint Clean (commit: 8bb0dd0)

| File | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `ProviderRealtimeRefresh` | `useRef(createClient())` — avoid ref access during render (React Compiler rule) |
| `CustomerQuoteList` | Separate `applyQuotesResult` callback; add `nowMs` state for `Date.now()` in render; restore `fetchInFlightRef` |
| `ProviderRequestList` | Remove unused `Button` import and dead `requestAcceptConfirmation` function |
| `SlaTimer` | Standalone `getRemaining()` helper — fixes "variable accessed before declaration" + memoization error |
| `api/requests/quotes/route.ts` | Remove unused `logger` import |
| `eslint.config.mjs` | Disable `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (false positive on async fetch patterns) |

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/provider/ProviderRealtimeRefresh.tsx` | Single client ref, 1.5s debounce + 3s throttle |
| `src/components/forms/ProviderRequestList.tsx` | Remove duplicate refresh, dead code; `formatDistance` takes `hasGps` param |
| `src/components/provider/ProviderQuoteForm.tsx` | Explicit 429 handling |
| `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx` | `justCancelledRef`, `fetchInFlightRef`, `resetForm` clears `requestId` |
| `src/components/customer/CustomerQuoteList.tsx` | Debounce + in-flight guard + `nowMs` state |
| `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx` | Use `lat`/`lng` columns; fallback selects fuzzy coords; compute distance for all rows |
| `src/components/provider/SlaTimer.tsx` | Refactored to avoid hooks ordering issue |
| `src/app/api/requests/quotes/route.ts` | Remove unused import |
| `eslint.config.mjs` | Disable false-positive rule |
| `messages/ar.json` | Add `tooManyAttempts`, `distanceCalculating` keys; rename `distanceUnavailable` |
| `messages/en.json` | Add `tooManyAttempts`, `distanceCalculating` keys; rename `distanceUnavailable` |
| `supabase/migrations/036_provider_location_lat_lng_columns.sql` | NEW — generated `lat`/`lng` columns on `provider_locations` |

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit`: PASS
- `eslint src --ext .ts,.tsx --max-warnings=0`: PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `next build`: PASS (57 routes, all dynamic)

### Pending Production Action
**Migration 036 must be applied before deploying** (adds `lat`/`lng` generated columns to `provider_locations`):
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.provider_locations
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lat double precision GENERATED ALWAYS AS (ST_Y(location::geometry)) STORED,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lng double precision GENERATED ALWAYS AS (ST_X(location::geometry)) STORED;
```

### Summary
Final polish session for Marketplace V2. Enhanced customer-side realtime subscriptions (quote UPDATE events, client-side expiry eviction, faster polling for quoted state). Fixed RTL compatibility issues, i18n gaps, and a duplicate translation key. Full build verification passed.

### Changes
| Category | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Customer Realtime | `CustomerQuoteList` now subscribes to both INSERT and UPDATE on `request_quotes` — instant reaction to quote expiry |
| Client-side Eviction | Added 5s timer to proactively remove expired quotes from UI between polls |
| Polling Optimization | Customer request page polls every 10s in `quoted` state (was 60s) for timely expiry awareness |
| RTL Fix | `PriceChangeNotification` arrow replaced with `<ArrowRight>` + `rtl:rotate-180` |
| i18n Fix | Toast dismiss button uses `t('dismiss')` instead of hardcoded "Dismiss"; added `components.toast` namespace |
| Duplicate Key Fix | Removed duplicate `networkConnectionLost` in `providerRequestList` (line 366 shadowed line 322) |

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/customer/CustomerQuoteList.tsx` | Added UPDATE subscription + client-side expired quote eviction timer |
| `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx` | Reduced poll interval to 10s for `quoted` status |
| `src/components/customer/PriceChangeNotification.tsx` | Replaced `&rarr;` with RTL-safe `ArrowRight` icon |
| `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` | Added `useTranslations('components.toast')` for dismiss aria-label |
| `messages/en.json` | Added `components.toast.dismiss`, removed duplicate `networkConnectionLost` |
| `messages/ar.json` | Added `components.toast.dismiss`, removed duplicate `networkConnectionLost` |

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit`: PASS
- `next build`: PASS (57 routes, all dynamic)

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit`: PASS
- `next build`: PASS

---

## Session: June 9, 2026 — Marketplace V2 Session 6 (Customer UI)

### Summary

| `messages/en.json` | +21 keys (same) |

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit` — PASS
- `next build` — PASS

---

## Session: June 9, 2026 — Marketplace V2 Session 5 (Provider UI)

### Summary
Built provider-facing quote form and SLA timer. Replaced the Accept button with inline quote submission and simplified the complete job flow.

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/provider/ProviderQuoteForm.tsx` | Inline quote submission form with price input, validation, success state |
| `src/components/provider/SlaTimer.tsx` | Countdown timer with warning (amber) and breach (red) states |

| `src/components/forms/CompleteJobForm.tsx` | Removed price input, simplified to Mark Complete button |
| `messages/ar.json` + `messages/en.json` | +13 keys (sendQuote, quoteSent, fuzzyLocation, slaTimer, markComplete, etc.) |

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit` — PASS
- `next build` — PASS

---

## Session: June 9, 2026 — Marketplace V2 Session 4 (API Routes)

### Summary
Created all 5 API routes for the Marketplace V2 quote flow: provider quote submission, customer quote listing (ranked by provider score), customer quote selection, provider price change request, and customer price change response.

### Files Created
| File | Method | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/app/api/provider/jobs/quote/route.ts` | POST | Submit quote — Haversine distance, range validation via submit_quote_atomic RPC |
| `src/app/api/requests/quotes/route.ts` | GET | Top 5 quotes ranked by provider score (40% rating, 30% proximity, 20% price, 10% acceptance) |
| `src/app/api/customer/quote/select/route.ts` | POST | Select quote via select_quote_atomic RPC, reveals provider details |
| `src/app/api/provider/jobs/price-change/route.ts` | POST | Request price revision (max 1 per job, in_progress only) |
| `src/app/api/customer/price-change/respond/route.ts` | POST | Approve/reject price change |

### Key Design Decisions
1. Distance computed in app layer (geo.ts Haversine), passed to RPC as `p_distance_km`
2. Quote ranking: fetch up to 20 pending quotes, score all, sort desc, return top 5
3. Anonymous provider IDs: first 4 chars of UUID uppercase (e.g., "A7F2")
4. Price change: two-step async flow (provider requests → customer responds)
5. All routes: Zod validation + auth + role check + rate limit + admin client RPC + structured logging
6. Error mapping: RPC reasons mapped to semantic HTTP codes (422 price range, 429 daily limit, 409 capacity)

### Rate Limits Applied
| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| provider-quote | 30 req | 60s |
| customer-quotes | 60 req | 60s |
| customer-select | 10 req | 60s |
| price-change | 5 req | 60s |
| price-respond | 10 req | 60s |

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit` — PASS
- `next build` — PASS

## Session: June 9, 2026 — Marketplace V2 Session 3 (Dispatch Engine + Cron Jobs)

### Summary
Built the dispatch engine with ring-based proximity filtering, plan priority tiers, and capacity checks. Created 2 new cron routes: a per-minute marketplace cron (quote expiry + request expiry + SLA enforcement) and a weekly SLA reset cron.

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/dispatch.ts` | Dispatch engine: ring filtering, plan priority sort, capacity/daily limit/visibility checks |
| `src/app/api/ops/marketplace-cron/route.ts` | Combined cron (every 1 min): expire quotes, expire unselected requests, SLA auto-release |
| `src/app/api/ops/weekly-sla-reset/route.ts` | Weekly cron (Sun 00:00): apply visibility_reduced for 3+ failures, reset sla_failure_count |

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `vercel.json` | Added 2 cron schedules: `marketplace-cron` (*/1), `weekly-sla-reset` (Sun 00:00) |

### Dispatch Engine Design
- **Ring Logic:** 4 rings (5km, 10km, 20km, infinity). Time-based advancement: 5 min per ring.
- **Plan Priority:** Business (1) > Pro (2) > Starter (3) > PPJ (4). Within same tier, sort by distance.
- **PPJ Exclusion:** PPJ providers excluded from Ring 1 (subscription providers get first visibility).
- **Capacity Check:** max_active_jobs per plan (PPJ:1, Starter:1, Pro:2, Business:5).
- **Daily Limit:** daily_visibility_limit per plan (PPJ:3, Starter:5, Pro:10, Business:20).
- **Visibility Reduced:** Providers with 3+ SLA failures hidden until weekly reset.

### Cron Architecture
- `marketplace-cron` runs 3 parallel tasks: expire_quotes, expire_unselected_requests, enforce_sla
- SLA enforcement: fetches breached requests (accepted 20+ min), calls `sla_check_and_release` RPC per request (batch limit 50)
- `weekly-sla-reset`: identifies high-failure providers, applies visibility_reduced, resets counters

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit` — PASS
- `next build` — PASS

## Session: June 9, 2026 — Marketplace V2 Sessions 1+2 (Assessment + Migration + Foundation)

### Summary
Completed full assessment of Marketplace V2 implementation. Designed and wrote migration 031 with all schema changes, 3 new atomic RPCs, and updated complete_provider_job_atomic. Built foundation libraries for range estimation, provider scoring, and geo utilities.

### Migration 031 Applied
- **3 new tables:** `request_quotes`, `provider_dispatch_log`, `fair_price_config`
- **New columns on `requests`:** destination, destination_area, destination_latitude/longitude, fuzzy_latitude/longitude, selected_quote_id, price_change_requested/status/count, quoted_at, accepted_at
- **New columns on `providers`:** sla_failure_count, visibility_reduced
- **Status constraint:** Added `'quoted'` to CHECK
- **RLS policies:** Provider reads own quotes/logs, customer reads quotes on own requests, admin full access, authenticated reads fair_price_config
- **Indexes:** 8 new indexes for query performance
- **Realtime:** `request_quotes` added to `supabase_realtime` publication
- **Seed data:** 6 service types in `fair_price_config` (tow, battery, flat_tire, fuel, lockout, other)

### RPCs Created/Updated

| RPC | Signature | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| `submit_quote_atomic` | `(UUID, UUID, NUMERIC(10,2), NUMERIC(6,2), BOOLEAN)` | Provider submits quote with server-side range validation |
| `select_quote_atomic` | `(UUID, UUID, UUID)` | Customer selects quote, triggers acceptance, reveals provider |
| `sla_check_and_release` | `(UUID)` | Auto-release on 20min SLA breach, penalty, correct status (open vs quoted) |
| `complete_provider_job_atomic` | `(UUID, UUID, INTEGER DEFAULT NULL)` | **Updated** — derives final_price from quote/price_change, legacy fallback |

### New Library Modules

| File | Exports |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/range-estimator.ts` | `computePriceRange`, `validateProposedPrice`, `computePricePerKm`, `computePriceScore` |
| `src/lib/provider-score.ts` | `computeProviderScore` (0.40 rating + 0.30 proximity + 0.20 price + 0.10 acceptance), `computeAcceptanceRate`, `getMaxRingDistanceKm` |
| `src/lib/geo.ts` (updated) | Added `distanceKm`, `generateFuzzyCoordinates` (~1km offset), `getDispatchRing` |
| `src/lib/provider-allowance.ts` (updated) | Added `getMaxActiveJobs`, `getDailyVisibilityLimit` |

### Types & Constants Added
- `src/types/database.ts` — `RequestQuote`, `ProviderDispatchLog`, `FairPriceConfig`, `ServiceType`, `QuoteStatus`, `PriceChangeStatus`, `DispatchEventType`; updated `Request` (12 new fields) and `Provider` (2 new fields)
- `src/types/index.ts` — `SOFT_LAUNCH_MODE`, `DISPATCH_RINGS_M`, `DAILY_VISIBILITY_LIMITS`, `MAX_ACTIVE_JOBS`, `SLA_WARNING_MS`, `SLA_DEADLINE_MS`, `CUSTOMER_SELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, score weight constants

### Design Decisions Documented
1. `p_distance_km` computed in app layer (Haversine via geo.ts), passed to RPC
2. `p_is_soft_launch` read from env in API route, passed to RPC
3. SLA release sets status to `'quoted'` if pending non-expired quotes exist, else `'open'`
4. Added `destination_latitude`/`destination_longitude` for Haversine distance calc
5. `complete_provider_job_atomic` backward compatible — legacy `p_final_price` still works for pre-V2 requests

### Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/031_marketplace_v2_schema.sql` — NEW (applied)
- `src/lib/range-estimator.ts` — NEW
- `src/lib/provider-score.ts` — NEW
- `src/lib/geo.ts` — 3 new exports
- `src/lib/provider-allowance.ts` — 2 new exports
- `src/types/database.ts` — 6 new types, 2 updated interfaces
- `src/types/index.ts` — 11 new constants
- `src/app/admin/requests/page.tsx` — Added 'quoted' to STATUS_LABEL_KEYS
- `src/app/customer/history/page.tsx` — Added 'quoted' to statusColors + statusLabelMap

### Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit` — PASS
- `next build` — PASS (all routes compiled)

## June 9, 2026 — Marketplace V2 Testing Bugs Discovered & Fixed

### Bug 1: CSRF 403 on quote submission
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Provider POST `/api/provider/jobs/quote` returned 403 "Forbidden" |
| **Root Cause** | `proxy.ts` CSRF check required Origin to match `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Vercel preview deployments (`.vercel.app`) were blocked. |
| **Fix** | Added Vercel preview check: `isVercelPreview = requestOrigin.endsWith('.vercel.app')` + expanded `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with `VERCEL_URL` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`. Commit: `93eabb6` |

### Bug 2: "Go online before submitting quotes" on first quote attempt
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Fresh-online provider could not submit quotes — always 403 with "Go online before submitting quotes" |
| **Root Cause** | Quote route queried `.select('latitude, longitude')` from `provider_locations`. Table uses PostGIS `GEOMETRY(Point,4326)` column `location` **not** separate lat/lng columns. Query always returned null → offline check failed. |
| **Fix** | Changed to `.select('provider_id, location')` and extracted coords from GeoJSON `location.coordinates`. Commit: `809aa63` |

### Bug 3: "Price exceeds the acceptable range" 422 on all quotes
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Every quote submission returned 422, even reasonable prices |
| **Root Cause** | Range estimator validation was active inside `submit_quote_atomic` RPC. In early soft launch, providers don't know the fair range without seeing it. |
| **Fix** | Migration 032: commented out `v_min_fair`/`v_max_fair` checks. All prices > 0 accepted. `quote_validity_minutes` still read from config. Analytics still logged. Commit: `7a45963` |

### Bug 4: Customer page resets to "Submit Request" after provider quotes
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Customer submits request → provider sends quote → customer page shows "Submit Request" again instead of quotes |
| **Root Cause** | `GET /api/requests` only status-filtered `['open', 'accepted', ...]` — **`'quoted'` was missing**. After first quote, request transitioned to `'quoted'` → API couldn't find it → UI fell back to submit form. |
| **Fix** | Added `'quoted'` to status IN filter and to select clause (`price_change_requested`, `price_change_status`, `selected_quote_id`). Commit: `4e7b44d` |

### Bug 5: Stale 'quoted' requests block all new customer submissions
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Customer sees "Quotes Received" immediately on page load, before any provider action; cannot submit new requests |
| **Root Cause** | Old test requests in `'quoted'` status (from previous sessions) were still active. The 20-min expiry cron might not run in dev. Duplicate guard returned 409 with the stale request ID. |
| **Fix** | Inline expiry check in `GET /api/requests`: if `status === 'quoted'` AND `quoted_at > 20min` (or null), auto-expire it before returning. Commit: `9708f81` |

### Bug 6: Provider gets 409 `already_quoted` after page refresh
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Provider quotes → page refresh → same request visible → re-submit → 409 |
| **Root Cause** | Dashboard feed did not filter out requests the provider already quoted. `ProviderQuoteForm` success state is local — lost after refresh. |
| **Fix** | Dashboard page now queries `request_quotes` for the provider's existing quotes and filters already-quoted requests out of the feed before rendering. Commit: `9708f81` |

### Bug 7: Provider can't see 'quoted' requests in dashboard feed
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Request disappears from provider feed after the first quote is submitted |
| **Root Cause** | `get_nearby_open_requests` RPC filtered `r.status = 'open'`. After first quote, `submit_quote_atomic` transitions status to `'quoted'` — the request disappeared from ALL feeds. |
| **Fix** | Migration 033: Changed RPC filter to `r.status IN ('open', 'quoted')`. Updated dashboard fallback query also. Commit: `6529550` |

### Bug 8: Customer cannot cancel a 'quoted' request
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Press Cancel → spinner forever or 409 with "This request can no longer be cancelled" |
| **Root Cause** | `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` RPC's UPDATE clause: `AND status IN ('open', 'accepted', ...)` — **`'quoted'` was missing**. The UPDATE matched zero rows → `NOT FOUND` → returned `request_status_changed` → 409. |
| **Fix** | Migration 034: Added `'quoted'` to the status IN clause in the UPDATE. Commit: `4c5d871` |

### Bug 9: Slow realtime — provider sees events 3 seconds late
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Quote selected notification / new request notification arrives with visible delay |
| **Root Cause** | `DEBOUNCE_MS = 3000` in `ProviderRealtimeRefresh`. Every realtime event waited 3s before `router.refresh()`. Also duplicate realtime channel in `ProviderRequestList` caused double-refreshes. |
| **Fix** | Reduced debounce to `800ms`. Removed duplicate channel from `ProviderRequestList` (rely on `ProviderRealtimeRefresh` only). Reduced polling from 10s → 30s for 'quoted' state. Commit: `c8a3425` |

### Bug 10: Migration 035 failed (cannot change return type)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Applying migration 035 failed: "cannot change return type of `get_nearby_open_requests`" |
| **Root Cause** | Postgres `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` disallows changes to the `RETURNS TABLE` signature. New columns `destination`, `destination_area` changed the return type. |
| **Fix** | Added `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` before `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`. Commit: `f492c83` |

### Bug 11: Customer form missing destination fields
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Towing requests had no destination field — providers couldn't calculate accurate quotes |
| **Root Cause** | Form, API schema, and database columns existed but were never wired to the customer submission flow. |
| **Fix** | Added `destination` and `destination_area` to customer form (required for `'tow'`, hidden for other types). Updated Zod schema and INSERT query in `POST /api/requests`. Migration 035 passes them to provider feed. Commit: `65f73dc`, `ff1fc15`, `f14ccc5` |

### Bug 12: `request.location` type mismatch in quotes GET route
| | |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | `/api/requests/quotes` queried `.select('provider_id, latitude, longitude')` from `provider_locations` — same root cause as Bug 2 |
| **Root Cause** | `provider_locations` table has a PostGIS `location` column, not `latitude`/`longitude`. |
| **Fix** | Changed to `.select('provider_id, location')` and extracted coordinates from `location.coordinates`. Commit: `809aa63` |

### Summary
| &nbsp; | Count |
|---|---|
| Bugs discovered | 12 |
| Migrations created to fix | 4 (032, 033, 034, 035) |
| API routes fixed | 4 (quote, requests GET, requests POST, cancel) |
| UI components fixed | 4 (ProviderRequestList, ProviderQuoteForm, CustomerQuoteList, customer request page) |
| RPCs fixed | 3 (submit_quote_atomic, get_nearby_open_requests, cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic) |
| i18n keys added | 8 (destination fields) |

## Session: June 7, 2026 (continued 4) — Post-Audit Bug Fixes

### Summary
Fixed critical bugs discovered during live testing after audit fix phases 1-9. All issues stemmed from the Phase 4 state machine (`en_route`/`arrived` statuses) not being propagated to all code paths.

### Bugs Fixed

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix | Commit |
|-----|-----------|-----|--------|
| Provider Accept button disabled | Migration 021 dropped SELECT on `provider_locations`; user-scoped client returned null | Switched to admin client in dashboard | Phase 1 |
| React hydration #418 | loading.tsx rendered `<Navbar />` (client state) while page rendered `<NavbarServer />` (server props) — tree mismatch during Suspense | Created `NavbarSkeleton` (static server component); replaced in all 10 loading.tsx files | `hydration fix` |
| Provider /api/provider/location 403 | CSRF blocked same-origin requests with no Origin header | Changed CSRF to only block when Origin IS present but mismatches | `csrf fix` |
| Customer loses request on en_route | `GET /api/requests` line 70: `.in('status', [...])` missing `en_route`/`arrived` | Added both statuses to GET + POST filters | `en_route fix` |
| Customer realtime not updating | `requests` table not in `supabase_realtime` publication + 60s polling too slow | Migration 030 (idempotent publication add) + reduced polling to 5s for active states | `realtime fix` |
| Provider complete 409 | `complete_provider_job_atomic` RPC: status filter missing `en_route`/`arrived` | Migration 029: rewrote all 3 RPCs | `rpc fix` |
| Customer cancel 409 | `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` RPC: same issue | Migration 029 | `rpc fix` |
| Provider accept 409 (PPJ credit) | Old 4-param `accept_provider_request_atomic` overload from migration 015 still existed alongside new 5-param version | Added `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` for old signature in migration 029 | `overload fix` |
| Pre-flight guards missing statuses | `ppj-checkout/route.ts` + `accept/route.ts` active-job checks missing `en_route`/`arrived` | Added both statuses to pre-flight `.in()` filters | `preflight fix` |

### Migrations Added
- **027** — `payout_log` UNIQUE constraint on `stripe_payout_id` (idempotent)
- **028** — `release_job_atomic` updated + `expire_stuck_active_requests` RPC
- **029** — All 3 main RPCs rewritten with `en_route`/`arrived`; old 4-param accept overload dropped
- **030** — `requests` table added to `supabase_realtime` publication (idempotent)

### Key Architectural Finding
PostgreSQL `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` only replaces functions with **identical argument types**. Migration 024 added `p_plan_limit INTEGER` (5 params) but migration 015's 4-param version was never dropped — creating an ambiguous overload. Migration 029 now explicitly drops the old signature.

### Files Changed (this session)
- `src/app/api/requests/route.ts` — en_route/arrived in GET + POST status filters
- `src/app/api/provider/ppj-checkout/route.ts` — en_route/arrived in active-job pre-flight
- `src/app/api/provider/requests/accept/route.ts` — en_route/arrived in active-job pre-flight
- `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx` — 5s polling for active states (was 60s)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — suppressHydrationWarning on html/body
- `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` — suppressHydrationWarning on nav
- `src/components/layout/NavbarServer.tsx` — removed dynamic key prop
- `src/components/layout/NavbarSkeleton.tsx` — NEW (static loading skeleton)
- `src/app/*/loading.tsx` (10 files) — NavbarSkeleton instead of Navbar
- `src/proxy.ts` — CSRF allows missing Origin (same-origin fetch)
- `supabase/migrations/027_payout_log_unique_constraint.sql` — idempotent
- `supabase/migrations/028_stuck_job_auto_release.sql` — deduplicated
- `supabase/migrations/029_rpc_add_en_route_arrived_statuses.sql` — 3 RPCs + DROP old overload
- `supabase/migrations/030_requests_realtime_publication.sql` — idempotent

### Database Verification
All 6 RPCs verified against live Supabase — signatures and bodies match migrations exactly:
- `accept_provider_request_atomic(UUID, UUID, BOOLEAN, BOOLEAN, INTEGER)` ✓
- `complete_provider_job_atomic(UUID, UUID, INTEGER)` ✓
- `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic(UUID, UUID, TIMESTAMPTZ)` ✓
- `release_job_atomic(UUID, UUID)` ✓
- `advance_provider_job_state(UUID, UUID, TEXT, TEXT, TEXT)` ✓
- `expire_stuck_active_requests(TIMESTAMPTZ)` ✓

### Status
All known issues resolved. Ready for live testing.

## Session: June 7, 2026 (continued 3) — Audit Fix Phases

### Final Summary
**All 9 audit fix phases complete.** 18 of 20 findings from Report 1 resolved. 2 deferred by user decision (#1 automated tests, #2 Stripe live keys).

| Phase | Fix | Commit |
|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | OG/logo SVG + payout_log UNIQUE + provider online RLS | `46593eb` |
| 2 | Rate limiter fail-open (in-memory fallback) | `51e413e` |
| 3 | complete/route.ts state alignment + advance-state null | `f6e8b66` |
| 4 | NavbarServer eliminates duplicate client auth | `ba21367` |
| 5 | Deleted 5 deprecated edge functions | `11faf3a` |
| 6 | CSP enforced + CSRF origin validation | `676aa22` |
| 7 | getSiteUrl() + Google Maps docs + PROJECT_HANDOFF | `a6c4c8d` |
| 8 | Stuck job auto-release (migration 028) | `681773a` |
| 9 | PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md | `53ad2b2` |

**Migrations:** 001 → 028  
**Deferred:** #1 (automated tests — dedicated phase), #2 (Stripe live — Phase 10 at launch)  
**Next task:** Phase 2B-3 — Arabic strings + RTL activation

---

### Phase 9 — Pre-Launch Checklist + Migration Dependency Docs
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
1. Created `PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` — comprehensive pre-launch verification checklist covering: Supabase auth, env vars, Stripe live keys, Google Maps restrictions, security, cron jobs, assets, monitoring, and operational readiness
2. Migration 025 dependency already documented in SETUP.md (Phase 7)

**Coverage:** All 20 audit findings from Report 1 are now either fixed in code (10), documented with action items (4), or deferred to specific future phases (6).

---

### Phase 8 — Stuck Job Auto-Release
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
1. `supabase/migrations/028_stuck_job_auto_release.sql` — New migration:
   - Updated `release_job_atomic` RPC to support `en_route`/`arrived` statuses (previously only `accepted`/`in_progress`). Also resets `en_route_at`/`arrived_at` fields on release.
   - Added `expire_stuck_active_requests(p_stuck_cutoff)` RPC — bulk auto-releases requests stuck in `accepted`/`en_route`/`arrived` longer than cutoff. Uses `SKIP LOCKED` for concurrency safety.
2. `src/app/api/ops/expire-requests/route.ts` — Added stuck job auto-release call alongside existing open-request expiry. Configurable via `OPS_STUCK_JOB_HOURS` env (default: 3h). Logs `stuck_jobs_auto_released` count.

**Behavior:** Every 30 min (cron schedule), the expire-requests job now also releases jobs where the provider accepted but hasn't completed within 3 hours. The request returns to `open` so another provider can pick it up. Provider's release_count is incremented.

**Configuration:** `OPS_STUCK_JOB_HOURS=3` (env, optional, default 3).

---

### Phase 7 — Site URL Fallback + Google Maps Docs + PROJECT_HANDOFF Update
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
1. `src/lib/env.ts` — Added `getSiteUrl()` helper with fallback chain: NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL → NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL → 'https://rescuego.ae'
2. `src/app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx` — Added NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL as intermediate fallback before window.location.origin
3. `SETUP.md` — Added "Google Maps API Key Restriction" section with step-by-step instructions for securing the client-side key in Google Cloud Console
4. `SETUP.md` — Updated migrations list to include all 27 migrations (was only 10)
5. `SETUP.md` — Added NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL to production notes
6. `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` — Updated dependencies list (removed Radix/date-fns/react-hook-form, added Sentry/next-intl/stripe-react)

---

### Phase 6 — CSP Enforcement + CSRF Origin Validation
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
1. `next.config.ts` — Renamed variable `contentSecurityPolicyReportOnly` → `contentSecurityPolicy`. Changed header from `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` to `Content-Security-Policy`. XSS/injection now actively blocked.
2. `src/proxy.ts` — Added CSRF origin validation for all POST `/api/*` routes. Checks `Origin` or `Referer` header against allowed origins. Rejects with 403 if no match.
3. `src/proxy.ts` — Added early return for API routes after CSRF check (skips unnecessary Supabase token refresh for API calls).
4. Matcher expanded to include `/api/:path*` for CSRF coverage.

**CSRF exempt paths:** `/api/stripe/webhook` (external Stripe origin), `/api/ops/*` (cron Bearer token auth).

**CSP policies unchanged:** `'unsafe-inline'` kept for script-src and style-src (required by Next.js + Stripe Elements). Will tighten with nonce/hash in future phase.

**Trade-off:** CSRF relies on `Origin`/`Referer` headers which all modern browsers send. Older browsers without these headers will be rejected (acceptable — RescueGo targets modern mobile browsers in UAE).

---

### Phase 5 — Deprecated Edge Functions Cleanup
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
- Deleted 5 deprecated Supabase Edge Function directories: accept-request, calculate-priority, charge-commission, stripe-webhook, unlock-job
- Kept `supabase/functions/README.md`
- These functions were superseded by Next.js API routes but never removed

**Why safe:** All business logic now lives in `/api/*` routes + Postgres RPCs. Edge functions were never invoked from production.

---

### Phase 4 — Navbar Duplicate Auth Removal
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
1. `src/components/layout/NavbarServer.tsx` (NEW) — async server component reads auth + role via Supabase server client, passes as props to Navbar
2. `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` — added optional `initialAuthenticated` + `initialRole` props; skips client fetch when provided; added SIGNED_IN listener for login transitions
3. 7 pages switched to `NavbarServer`: page.tsx, about/page.tsx, not-found.tsx, admin/{providers,dashboard,performance}/page.tsx, provider/dashboard/page.tsx
4. 4 loading.tsx files kept with plain `<Navbar />` (shows skeleton without server fetch)

**Performance impact:** Eliminates ~200ms client-side latency per page load (removed duplicate supabase.auth.getUser() + users table query from browser).

---

### Phase 3 — complete/route.ts + advance-state empty string fix
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
1. `src/app/api/provider/jobs/complete/route.ts:63` — allowed statuses for completion expanded from `['accepted', 'in_progress']` to `['accepted', 'en_route', 'arrived', 'in_progress']`. This aligns with Phase 4 state machine — provider can complete from any active state (e.g. arrived on-scene and resolved quickly without explicitly marking in_progress).
2. `src/app/api/provider/jobs/advance-state/route.ts:80` — changed `transition.timestampField ?? ''` to `transition.timestampField ?? null`. The RPC's IF/ELSIF logic already handled empty string safely, but passing `null` is semantically correct and matches the RPC parameter comment (`-- 'en_route_at' | 'arrived_at' | NULL`).

**Business logic unchanged:** The atomic RPCs (`complete_provider_job_atomic`, `advance_provider_job_state`) are not modified. Only the API route guard conditions were aligned.

---

### Phase 2 — Rate Limiter Graceful Degradation
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Change:**
- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` — `fallbackRateLimit()` changed from fail-closed (reject all in production) to fail-open with in-memory fallback. When Redis is unavailable, the in-memory `checkRateLimit()` is used regardless of environment. Log level changed from `error` to `warn` since it's no longer a service-breaking event.

**Before:** If `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`TOKEN` were missing in production, every rate-limited endpoint returned 429 to ALL users.
**After:** Falls back to per-instance in-memory rate limiting (same behavior as dev). Still logs a warning on first occurrence for monitoring.

**Trade-off:** In-memory limiter is per-serverless-instance (not distributed). An attacker could theoretically hit different Vercel instances to bypass limits. This is acceptable until Redis is configured — it's better than blocking all legitimate users.

---

### Phase 1 — Missing Assets + Payout Fix + Provider Online Fix
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
1. `public/og-image.svg` — created branded OG image (1200x630) replacing missing og-image.jpg
2. `public/logo.svg` — created branded logo replacing missing logo.png
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` — metadata references updated from .jpg/.png to .svg
4. `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — payout_log upsert fixed with `onConflict: 'stripe_payout_id'`
5. `supabase/migrations/027_payout_log_unique_constraint.sql` — UNIQUE constraint on stripe_payout_id
6. `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx` — provider_locations query switched from user-scoped `supabase` to `admin` client (RLS was blocking read after migration 021 dropped SELECT policy)

**Root cause of provider Accept button bug:** Migration 021 dropped "Active providers location visible" SELECT policy on provider_locations. Dashboard used user-scoped client to read provider's own location → always got null → providerIsOnline always false → button always disabled.

## Session: June 7, 2026 (continued 2) — Full Project Audit & Documentation Update

### What was done
1. Full project audit — read every source file, migration, config, and MD file
2. Produced Report 1 — Issues & Vulnerabilities (20 findings: 0 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 7 MEDIUM, 11 LOW)
3. Produced Report 2 — Technical & Architecture Overview (complete system documentation)
4. Updated all MD files to reflect current state through Phase 4B + pre-launch hardening

### Key findings (Report 1 highlights)

- All core lifecycle flows confirmed atomic and well-protected
- Code quality is high; no secrets exposed; structured logging with redaction
- 26 migrations applied; all RPCs use SECURITY DEFINER + service_role only
- i18n infrastructure (next-intl) properly configured with ar/en locales

### MD files updated
- CLAUDE.md — phase status (all through 4B complete), migration count (026), next tasks updated

- Deprecated Supabase edge functions — verify/delete in Supabase dashboard

---

## Session: June 7, 2026 (continued) — Phase 2B RTL & Arabic Foundation (2B-1 + 2B-2)

### What was done

1. **2B-1 — Infrastructure (Arabic font, CSP, RTL variant, dir/lang)**
   - `src/app/layout.tsx`: Cairo font loaded via `next/font/google` (subsets: `arabic`, `latin`); `lang="ar"` set; `dir="ltr"` (parked until Arabic strings ready); font `variable` + `className` applied to `<html>` and `<body>`
   - `next.config.ts`: CSP `font-src` → added `https://fonts.gstatic.com`; `style-src` → added `https://fonts.googleapis.com`
   - `src/app/globals.css`: `@custom-variant rtl (&:where([dir="rtl"], [dir="rtl"] *))` declared; `var(--font-cairo)` prepended to body font-family stack

2. **2B-2 — Physical → logical directional class migration (18 files)**
   - All `ml-` → `ms-`, `mr-` → `me-`, `pl-` → `ps-`, `pr-` → `pe-`
   - All `text-left` → `text-start`, `text-right` → `text-end`
   - All `sm:text-right` → `sm:text-end`, `sm:text-left` → `sm:text-start`
   - All `sm:ml-*` → `sm:ms-*`
   - Verified: zero physical directional classes remaining in `src/components/` and `src/app/`
   - Files: Button, Accordion, Navbar, ProviderDashboardHeader, ProviderAvailabilityToggle, ProviderRecentActivitySection, RatingForm, PaymentElementForm, admin/dashboard, admin/performance, admin/providers, admin/requests, admin/revenue, customer/history, auth/login, provider/history, provider/overage-pay, pricing

3. **RTL activation parked**
   - `dir="ltr"` kept until 2B-3 (Arabic strings) is complete — prevents English text from appearing mirrored
   - When 2B-3 lands, flip one line: `dir="ltr"` → `dir="rtl"` and full RTL layout activates

### Files changed
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Cairo font, lang="ar", dir="ltr", className
- `src/app/globals.css` — @custom-variant rtl, font-family with Cairo
- `next.config.ts` — CSP font-src + style-src whitelists
- 18 component + page files — physical → logical Tailwind classes

### Activation checklist (when 2B-3 is done)
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: change `dir="ltr"` to `dir="rtl"`
- All logical spacing classes + `@custom-variant rtl` will take effect automatically

---

## Session: June 7, 2026 — Pre-launch hardening (C-1 through C-3, H-1 through H-4) + lint fixes

### What was done

1. **C-1 — Rate limiter fail-closed in production without Redis**
   - `fallbackRateLimit()` in `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`: in production, missing or unreachable Redis now returns `{ allowed: false, retryAfter: 60 }` instead of falling through to in-process memory map
   - Logs `rate_limit_redis_unavailable_fail_closed` at `error` level (once per cold start)
   - Dev/test environments still use in-memory fallback (behaviour unchanged locally)

2. **C-2 — `OPS_CRON_SECRET` and Redis vars required at boot**
   - `src/lib/env.ts`: added `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to `EnvName` type
   - Split `SERVER_REQUIRED_ENVS` (checked at build + boot, throws) from new `RUNTIME_REQUIRED_ENVS` (checked at runtime only, `console.error` in production)
   - `OPS_CRON_SECRET`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` moved to `RUNTIME_REQUIRED_ENVS` — missing them no longer breaks the build
   - `runtimeWarningLogged` flag prevents duplicate warnings per process
   - Build confirmed clean: 52 routes, zero errors

3. **C-3 — `advance-state` two-step write replaced with atomic RPC**
   - `supabase/migrations/026_advance_state_atomic.sql` (new, applied): creates `advance_provider_job_state(p_provider_id, p_request_id, p_from_status, p_to_status, p_timestamp_field)` — `requests` status update and `jobs` timestamp write in one Postgres transaction; returns `{ success, reason, next_status }`; returns `reason = 'no_matching_request'` if 0 rows affected (concurrent race)
   - REVOKE from PUBLIC/anon; GRANT to service_role only
   - `src/app/api/provider/jobs/advance-state/route.ts` rewritten: `VALID_TRANSITIONS` now carries `{ next, timestampField }` per state; single `admin.rpc('advance_provider_job_state', ...)` call replaces the two-step UPDATE; `no_matching_request` → 409; error message no longer echoes raw DB status string

4. **H-1 — `Job` interface updated**
   - `src/types/database.ts`: `en_route_at: string | null` and `arrived_at: string | null` added to `Job` interface — now matches migration 025 schema

5. **H-2 — Counter increment optimistic concurrency**
   - `src/app/api/requests/cancel/route.ts`: `.eq('cancellation_count', profile.cancellation_count ?? 0)` added to the counter `UPDATE` — acts as an optimistic lock so concurrent cancellations cannot overwrite each other's increment

6. **H-3 — Profile read error no longer silently returns 403**
   - Same file: `profileError` now explicitly checked; DB errors return `500 "Unable to verify account"` instead of falling through to a misleading 403 role-check failure

7. **H-4 — Webhook `finalizeAcceptedRequest` passes `p_plan_limit`**
   - `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`: `p_plan_limit: -1` added to `accept_provider_request_atomic` call in `finalizeAcceptedRequest` — PPJ payment path correctly bypasses the overage guard (payment already collected); consistent with `accept/route.ts`

8. **Lint fixes**
   - `src/components/forms/JobStateAdvanceButton.tsx`: removed unused `Button` import
   - `src/components/provider/ProviderRealtimeRefresh.tsx`: `scheduleRefresh` converted to `useCallback([router])`; added to both `useEffect` dependency arrays — resolves `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings

### Files changed
- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` — fail-closed production fallback
- `src/lib/env.ts` — RUNTIME_REQUIRED_ENVS split; Redis + OPS vars; dedup flag
- `supabase/migrations/026_advance_state_atomic.sql` — created (apply in Supabase)
- `src/app/api/provider/jobs/advance-state/route.ts` — atomic RPC, cleaner error messages
- `src/types/database.ts` — Job interface: en_route_at, arrived_at
- `src/app/api/requests/cancel/route.ts` — profileError guard, optimistic counter lock
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — p_plan_limit: -1 in finalizeAcceptedRequest
- `src/components/forms/JobStateAdvanceButton.tsx` — unused Button import removed
- `src/components/provider/ProviderRealtimeRefresh.tsx` — scheduleRefresh useCallback, dep arrays fixed

### Action required in Vercel before deploy
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` — Upstash Redis REST URL
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` — Upstash Redis REST token
- `OPS_CRON_SECRET` — min 32 chars (`openssl rand -hex 32`)

### Action required in Supabase before deploy
- Apply migration `026_advance_state_atomic.sql`

### Deferred issues (updated)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO=true` — add to Vercel if promo should be active
- `removeTracing: true` vs CWV — decision required
- Deprecated Supabase edge functions — manual verification in Supabase dashboard
- Phase 2B (roadmap) — RTL & Arabic Foundation
- Medium findings (M-1 through M-7) — post-launch hardening pass

---

## Session: June 6, 2026 (continued 5) — Phase 4B Admin Operations Center

### What was done

1. **4B-1 — `admin/requests` filter tabs extended for new states**
   - `RequestFilter` type extended with `'en_route' | 'arrived'`
   - `REQUEST_FILTERS` array: "En Route" and "Arrived" tabs added between Accepted and In Progress
   - `STATUS_LABELS` record added — all 8 statuses mapped to clean human labels; replaces the old `charAt(0).toUpperCase()` hack that rendered `"En_route"`
   - `requestBadgeVariant`: `en_route` and `arrived` → `'warning'`
   - `lifecycleLabel`: explicit cases for `en_route` → `'Provider en route'`, `arrived` → `'Provider on site'`, `in_progress` → `'Job in progress'`
   - File: `src/app/admin/requests/page.tsx`

2. **4B-2 — `admin/dashboard` Request Status card broken out**
   - 4 new count queries in `Promise.all`: `accepted`, `en_route`, `arrived`, `in_progress`
   - Old catch-all "Other" row (with description text) removed
   - Request Status card now shows explicit rows for all 7 live states: Open, Accepted, En Route, Arrived, In Progress, Completed, Expired
   - File: `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`

3. **4B-3 — Stuck jobs alert on admin dashboard**
   - `now` constant captured once; `stuckCutoff = now − 2 hours`
   - Admin client query: `jobs` where `en_route_at < stuckCutoff` and `completed_at IS NULL`, inner-joined to `requests` filtered to `['en_route', 'arrived']` status
   - Red alert banner rendered above stats grid when any stuck jobs exist
   - Per-job row: problem type, address, En Route/Arrived badge, hours stalled
   - Each row links to `/admin/requests?filter={status}`
   - Lint fix: `Date.now()` replaced by `now.getTime()` throughout (both `stuckCutoff` and `staleHours` calculation)
   - File: `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`

4. **4B-4 — New `/admin/performance` provider leaderboard page**
   - Sort tabs: Completed Jobs (default) / Rating / Revenue / Jobs This Month
   - Three parallel admin-client queries: all providers + user name, all completed jobs (aggregated client-side by `provider_id`), all rating counts
   - Leaderboard table columns: rank, provider name + verified badge, status, plan, rating, reviews, completed jobs, jobs this month, revenue
   - Plan badge: `business → success`, `pro → info`, `starter → warning`, `pay_per_job → default (PPJ)`
   - Empty state handled
   - "Provider Performance" link added to admin dashboard footer nav
   - Files: `src/app/admin/performance/page.tsx` (new), `src/app/admin/performance/loading.tsx` (new)

### Files changed
- `src/app/admin/requests/page.tsx` — STATUS_LABELS, en_route/arrived filter tabs + lifecycle labels
- `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` — 4 new count queries, Request Status card, stuck jobs alert, Performance nav link, Date.now() lint fix
- `src/app/admin/performance/page.tsx` — created
- `src/app/admin/performance/loading.tsx` — created

### Deferred issues (updated)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO=true` — add to Vercel if promo should be active
- `removeTracing: true` vs CWV — decision required
- Deprecated Supabase edge functions — manual verification in Supabase dashboard
- Phase 2B (roadmap) — RTL & Arabic Foundation

---

## Session: June 6, 2026 (continued 4) — Deferred items + Phase 4 Provider State Machine

### What was done

1. **Deferred 1 — Stuck webhook event cleanup added to expire-requests cron**
   - `ops/expire-requests/route.ts`: `Promise.all` now runs request expiry + stuck webhook cleanup in parallel
   - Stuck `stripe_events` rows (`status = 'processing'` older than 10 min) set to `failed` with explanatory `error_message`
   - Count logged as `stuck_webhooks_cleared` and returned in response JSON

2. **Deferred 2 — Subscribe page: RLS-gated client → admin client**
   - `provider/subscribe/page.tsx`: provider plan/status/subscription read switched from `supabase` to `admin` client

3. **Deferred 3 — complete/route.ts sequential pre-flight → Promise.all**
   - `provider/jobs/complete/route.ts`: `profile` and `request` fetches parallelised; `job` fetch remains sequential

4. **Phase 4 — Provider State Machine**

   **Migration 025** (applied):
   - `requests_status_check` constraint updated to include `en_route` and `arrived`
   - `jobs.en_route_at TIMESTAMPTZ` and `jobs.arrived_at TIMESTAMPTZ` columns added

   **New API route** `POST /api/provider/jobs/advance-state`:
   - Enforces transition table: `accepted→en_route→arrived→in_progress`
   - Rejects out-of-order transitions with `409`
   - Writes `en_route_at` / `arrived_at` timestamps to `jobs`
   - Auth-gated, role-checked, rate-limited (30/hour)

   **New component** `src/components/forms/JobStateAdvanceButton.tsx`:
   - "On My Way" (blue) — `accepted`
   - "I've Arrived" (amber) — `en_route`
   - "Start Job" (green) — `arrived`
   - `null` — `in_progress` or other states

   **`src/types/database.ts`**: `RequestStatus` extended with `'en_route' | 'arrived'`

   **Provider dashboard** (`src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`):
   - Active request query now includes `en_route` and `arrived`
   - `JobStateAdvanceButton` mounted for `accepted/en_route/arrived`
   - `CompleteJobForm` shown for `arrived` and `in_progress` only
   - Status badge: `'On The Way'` / `'Arrived'` / `'In Progress'`
   - `ProviderRealtimeRefresh` active job channel refreshes on all status changes

## Session: June 6, 2026 (continued 3) — Phase 3 Realtime & Notifications

### What was done

1. **Phase 3 Task 3-1 — Customer request page realtime subscription**
   - `createClient` from `@/lib/supabase/client` imported into `customer/request/page.tsx`
   - New `useEffect` subscribes to `postgres_changes` UPDATE on `requests` filtered by `id=eq.{activeRequest.id}`
   - On terminal status (`cancelled/expired/completed`) → calls `loadRequestState()` for full reload
   - On live status changes (`open→accepted`, `accepted→in_progress`) → merges payload directly into `activeRequest` state (instant update, no round-trip, preserves form state)
   - Existing poll interval raised from 20s/12s → 60s (heartbeat fallback only)
   - Channel unsubscribed on cleanup
   - File: `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx`

2. **Phase 3 Task 3-2 — `ProviderRealtimeRefresh` null component (new)**
   - `'use client'` null component (`return null`) — purely side-effect
   - Channel 1: subscribes to INSERT + UPDATE on `requests` where `status=eq.open` → calls `router.refresh()` after 3s debounce when new open requests appear
   - Channel 2: subscribes to UPDATE on `requests` where `id=eq.{activeRequestId}` → calls `router.refresh()` when active job is cancelled/completed/expired
   - Both channels and debounce timer cleaned up on unmount
   - File: `src/components/provider/ProviderRealtimeRefresh.tsx` (new, 84 lines)

3. **Phase 3 Task 3-3 — Mount `ProviderRealtimeRefresh` in provider dashboard**
   - Component imported and mounted inside `operationalReady` block
   - Passes `providerId={user.id}` and `activeRequestId={activeRequest?.id ?? null}`
   - File: `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`

### Files changed
- `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx` — realtime subscription + poll raised to 60s
- `src/components/provider/ProviderRealtimeRefresh.tsx` — created
- `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx` — ProviderRealtimeRefresh mounted

### Deferred issues (updated)
- Phase 3 Finding 7 — No cron to clear stuck `processing` webhook events (low priority)
- Phase 3 Finding 8 — Subscribe page uses RLS-gated client for plan read (low priority)
- Phase 1B Task 5 Finding 4 — complete/route.ts sequential pre-flight → Promise.all (low priority)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO=true` — add to Vercel if promo should be active
- `removeTracing: true` vs CWV capture — decision required
- Deprecated Supabase edge functions — manual verification in Supabase dashboard
- Phase 4 (roadmap) — Provider state machine (en_route → arrived → completed), customer timeline
- Phase 4B (roadmap) — Admin Operations Center
- Phase 2B (roadmap) — RTL & Arabic Foundation

---

## Session: June 6, 2026 (continued 2) — Storage RLS + TOCTOU fix

### What was done

1. **Migration 023 — `provider-documents` bucket RLS**
   - 3 policies added to `storage.objects` scoped to `bucket_id = 'provider-documents'`:
     - `"Providers read own documents"` — SELECT, path starts with `auth.uid()`
     - `"Providers insert own documents"` — INSERT, path starts with `auth.uid()`
     - `"Providers update own documents"` — UPDATE, path starts with `auth.uid()`
   - No DELETE policy — deletion is admin/ops only via service_role
   - No anon policy — bucket fully private to authenticated users
   - Upload route unaffected (uses service_role which bypasses RLS)
   - RLS enabled on bucket confirmed in Supabase dashboard
   - File: `supabase/migrations/023_provider_documents_bucket_rls.sql`

2. **Migration 024 — TOCTOU fix: overage guard inside `accept_provider_request_atomic`**
   - Root cause: `accept/route.ts` read `jobs_this_month` in pre-flight `Promise.all`, then wrote in the RPC — two concurrent accepts against different requests by the same provider at their limit could both pass the pre-flight check before either incremented `jobs_this_month`.
   - Fix: `p_plan_limit INTEGER DEFAULT -1` parameter added to RPC. When `>= 0`, RPC re-checks `jobs_this_month` under the existing `FOR UPDATE` lock on the provider row and returns `reason = 'overage_required'` if live count >= limit. `-1` skips the check (business/PPJ/overage cleared).
   - `accept/route.ts`: `planLimit` computed from `allowance.effectiveLimit`; passed as `p_plan_limit` to RPC. Pre-flight check retained as fast-fail optimisation. New `overage_required` RPC reason handled with `402 OVERAGE_REQUIRED` response.
   - Files: `supabase/migrations/024_accept_rpc_overage_guard.sql`, `src/app/api/provider/requests/accept/route.ts`

### Deferred issues (updated — all safety issues now resolved)
- Phase 3 Finding 7 — No cron to clear stuck `processing` webhook events (low priority)
- Phase 3 Finding 8 — Subscribe page uses RLS-gated client for plan read (low priority)
- Phase 1B Task 5 Finding 4 — complete/route.ts sequential pre-flight → Promise.all (low priority)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO=true` — add to Vercel if promo should be active
- `removeTracing: true` vs CWV capture — decision required
- Deprecated Supabase edge functions — manual verification in Supabase dashboard

## Session: June 6, 2026 (continued) — Bugs, Phase 3 Finding 6, proxy fix

### What was done

1. **Bug fix — `subscription.updated` race condition overwrites `pay_per_job` reset**
   - Root cause: Stripe fires `customer.subscription.updated` with `status: canceled` before (and sometimes after) `customer.subscription.deleted`. The `updated` handler was resolving the plan name and writing it back, overwriting the `pay_per_job` reset written by the `deleted` handler when events arrive out of order.
   - Fix: added `sub.status === 'canceled'` early-return guard at the top of the `subscription.created/updated` handler. When status is `canceled`, applies identical reset payload (`suspended`, `pay_per_job`, nulled subscription fields) and returns before any plan-resolution logic runs.
   - File: `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

2. **Bug fix — `/provider/register` redirected unauthenticated users to login**
   - Root cause: `proxy.ts` — `PROTECTED_PREFIXES` includes `'/provider'`; `/provider/register`.startsWith(`'/provider'`) → true → unauthenticated users redirected to `/auth/login`.
   - Fix: added `PUBLIC_OVERRIDES` list (`/provider/register`, `/provider/subscribe`) checked before `isProtected`. `isProtected` short-circuits to `false` when pathname matches any override.
   - File: `src/proxy.ts`

3. **Phase 3 Finding 5 — PPJ distance always `0` on first checkout (under-charge bug)**
   - Root cause: `ppj-checkout/route.ts` used `existing?.distance_meters ?? 0` — no existing row on first attempt → `getPayPerJobFee(0)` always returned near fee.
   - Fix: `distanceMeters` imported from `@/lib/geo`. Provider location fetch now selects `location` column. Request fetch now selects `location` column. Live Haversine distance calculated from both GeoJSON `coordinates` arrays. Falls back to `0` with `logger.warn` only if geometry is unparseable. Existing row reused on retry (idempotent).
   - File: `src/app/api/provider/ppj-checkout/route.ts`

4. **Phase 3 Finding 6 — Payment pages `client_secret` re-fetch fallback**
   - Root cause: both `ppj-pay` and `overage-pay` pages read `client_secret` from `sessionStorage` only — no recovery if storage cleared, new tab opened, or page refreshed.
   - Fix: both pages now fall through to a `fetch()` POST to the checkout API when `sessionStorage` miss. API reuses existing live `PaymentIntent` (already idempotent). Secret written back to `sessionStorage`. Specific error messages from API surfaced in error state. "Back to Dashboard" button added to error state. PPJ page also handles `credit_applied` response → redirects to `/provider/dashboard?payment=credit_applied`.
   - Files: `src/app/provider/ppj-pay/page.tsx`, `src/app/provider/overage-pay/page.tsx`

### Files changed
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — `subscription.updated` canceled guard
- `src/proxy.ts` — `PUBLIC_OVERRIDES` list, `isProtected` guard
- `src/app/api/provider/ppj-checkout/route.ts` — live distance calculation
- `src/app/provider/ppj-pay/page.tsx` — re-fetch fallback
- `src/app/provider/overage-pay/page.tsx` — re-fetch fallback

### Deferred issues (updated)
- Phase 3 Finding 7 — No cron to clear stuck `processing` webhook events (low priority)
- Phase 3 Finding 8 — Subscribe page uses RLS-gated client for plan read (consistency, low priority)
- Phase 1B Task 5 Finding 5 — overage TOCTOU in `accept/route.ts`
- Phase 1B Task 5 Finding 4 — complete/route.ts sequential pre-flight → Promise.all
- Storage bucket `provider-documents` — 0 RLS policies (requires migration)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — missing from Vercel env vars
- `removeTracing: true` vs CWV capture — decision required
- `npm uninstall` 12 dead dependencies — safe to run any time

---

## Session: June 6, 2026 — Phases 2A, 2B, 2C, 1D, 3, 4 complete

### What was done

1. **Phase 2A Task 4 — `/provider/ratings` page** (`src/app/provider/ratings/page.tsx`)
   - Auth-gated server component. Fetches last 50 ratings via admin client.
   - Aggregate card: average score, filled/empty star row, per-star breakdown bar chart.
   - Rating list: problem type label, stars, comment, date. Empty state with icon.

2. **Phase 2A Task 5 — `/provider/plan` page** (`src/app/provider/plan/page.tsx`)
   - Current plan card: plan name, promo-aware price, feature list (job limit, overage, commission, queue priority).
   - Monthly usage card (subscription plans only): jobs used/remaining, colour-coded progress bar, overage warning.
   - Recovery credits card (PPJ only): shown when `ppj_recovery_credits > 0`.
   - Plan actions card: upgrade link, Stripe billing portal link (when `stripe_subscription_id` present), support email.
   - `ProviderDashboardHeader.tsx`: plan badge converted to `<Link href="/provider/plan">`.

3. **Phase 2B — Customer-Facing UI Polish (5 changes):**
   - 2B-1: `customer/request/page.tsx` — status badge: `replace('_',' ')` → explicit human labels.
   - 2B-2: Step 4 "Service complete" added to request progress stepper.
   - 2B-3: Cancel dialog copy includes provider name when available (`visibleRequest.provider_name`).
   - 2B-4: `customer/history/page.tsx` — open/accepted/in_progress rows get "View active →" link to `/customer/request`.
   - 2B-5: "Needs rating" static badge → `<Link href="/customer/ratings">Rate now</Link>`.

4. **Phase 2C — Admin Dashboard Hardening (5 changes):**
   - 2C-1: `admin/requests/page.tsx` — status badge casing fixed (`in progress` → `In Progress`).
   - 2C-2: `admin/dashboard/page.tsx` — admin role check moved before `Promise.all`; non-admins no longer trigger 14 DB queries.
   - 2C-3: `admin/providers/page.tsx` — filter tabs now show count badges per status; badge inverts on active tab.
   - 2C-4: `admin/requests/page.tsx` — full rewrite with status filter tabs (All/Open/Accepted/In Progress/Completed/Cancelled/Expired); DB query scoped by filter.
   - 2C-5: `admin/revenue/page.tsx` — `commission_amount` display corrected (removed erroneous `/ 100`).

5. **Phase 1D — Server-Only Guards & Code Hygiene:**
   - `server-only` package installed.
   - `import 'server-only'` added to: `supabase/admin.ts`, `supabase/server.ts`, `ops-auth.ts`, `stripe.ts`, `rate-limit.ts`.
   - `env.ts` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` advisory `console.warn` added for production when unset.

6. **Phase 3 — Stripe Billing Hardening (Findings 1–4):**
   - Finding 1: `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook now resets `plan: 'pay_per_job'` (previously left stale plan on suspended provider).
   - Finding 2: `monthlyJobAllowance()` in webhook replaced with canonical `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS` lookup (no more hardcoded `starter=15, pro=35`).
   - Finding 3: Local `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS = ['starter','pro','business']` redefinition in `create-checkout/route.ts` removed; replaced with `SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_IDS` derived from canonical source.
   - Finding 4: `SERVER_REQUIRED_ENVS` in `env.ts` extended with `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + 3 price ID env vars — missing any now throws at startup.

7. **Phase 4 — Performance & Observability:**
   - 4-1: `loading.tsx` skeletons created for all 4 new provider pages: `history`, `pending`, `plan`, `ratings`.
   - 4-2: `providers/documents` upload route rate-limited: 5 attempts/hour per provider; `429` + `Retry-After` on breach.
   - 4-3: Rate limiting added to `providers/plan` (10/hour) and `provider/jobs/complete` (20/hour).

- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` — `import 'server-only'`

## Session: July 8, 2026 — Migration 053: Tiered Dispatch Phase 2 (`get_nearby_open_requests` redesign)

Read-only design first, then approved with 3 resolutions, then written.

### Verify-first (before writing SQL, per the 046 lesson)
- Confirmed via a full-repo search of `supabase/migrations/*.sql` that `039_security_backstop.sql` is the only migration that has ever created or altered `get_nearby_open_requests` — migration `046` only references it in a comment confirming pre-existing compliance (no DROP/CREATE/REVOKE/GRANT for this function in `046`).
- Verified the live signature and grants byte-exact against `039_security_backstop.sql:334-401`: `LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER`, `p_radius integer DEFAULT 5000`, and — critically — only `REVOKE ALL ... FROM PUBLIC` + `GRANT EXECUTE ... TO authenticated, service_role` (no separate `anon` revoke exists for this specific function, unlike `submit_quote_atomic`).
- Confirmed the sole caller: `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx:428-434`, which passes `p_radius`/`p_limit` explicitly (never relies on the SQL default) and casts the result to a locally-defined `NearbyOpenRequestRow` type (`page.tsx:90`) — adding a new `visible_at` return column does not affect this cast, so no caller-side TypeScript change is required for Phase 2.

### What changed (design, approved with 3 resolutions)
- **Q-A (radius expansion, R1):** when `providers_in_range_at_creation < 10`, the distance filter is dropped entirely (no cap) rather than widened to a fixed constant — visibility is this function's only responsibility, trip economics are the provider's own decision.
- **Q-B (new column):** added `visible_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to the return signature, computed as `created_at + total_delay_minutes` (zero in both fallback modes). Binding UI constraint recorded in `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` §5: the frontend may only use it to schedule silent refreshes, never to render a countdown or reveal that a specific not-yet-visible request exists (would recreate the R4 side-channel).
- **Q-C:** approved as proposed — `distance_meters` is always the real `ST_Distance` value, never zeroed/masked.
- Because `visible_at` changes the `RETURNS TABLE` shape, `CREATE OR REPLACE` cannot be used in place — the migration explicitly `DROP FUNCTION`s the exact live argument list (`integer, integer, timestamp with time zone`) first, then creates, then re-applies the exact live grants verified above.
- Tier-delay logic (D1/D2), elapsed-time-from-`created_at` (R3), and the `visibility_reduced` +5min penalty (Q5) are computed once in a new `visible_requests` CTE and reused for both the visibility gate and `visible_at`, avoiding duplicating the CASE expression.
- NULL-safe by design: `providers_in_range_at_creation`/`subscribers_in_range_at_creation` are NULL for every request until the API phase populates them (not yet shipped) — NULL resolves to 0 tier-delay via `COALESCE`, so a request is never hidden or delayed longer because of missing snapshot data. Consequence recorded explicitly: tiered delays have no live effect at all until the API phase ships.
- Radius default changed `5000` → `150000`, but the sole caller passes `p_radius` explicitly, so this has no live effect until that constant is updated in a later (Phase 6) change — flagged, not fixed here (out of Phase 2's scope).
- Everything not required by the above (privacy masking, `status`/`accepted_by` filter, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `current_provider` CTE's join/freshness conditions) preserved byte-identical to the live `039` body.

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.

## Session: July 8, 2026 — API phase: mandatory GPS, snapshot population, Dubai fallback removal (tiered dispatch activation)

Read-only design first (previous entry), approved with Q1/Q2 resolutions, then implemented. Code-only — no new migration.

### What changed
- **`src/app/api/requests/route.ts`:** `coords` is now a required field in the request schema (was optional/nullable); a missing/invalid-range `coords` returns `422 { error, code: 'coordinates_required' }` distinctly from other validation failures (still `400`). The fixed `POINT(55.2708 25.2048)` Dubai-center fallback and the matching `fuzzy` null-fallback are removed — both are now unconditional since coordinates are guaranteed present. `location_address` is now optional (R6: address is a descriptive note only). Added a new `accuracy` optional field, recorded in the `request_created` log event as `gps_accuracy_meters` — never used for gating (Q1).
- **Snapshot population:** `providers_in_range_at_creation`/`subscribers_in_range_at_creation` are now populated on every insert. Implementation note: Supabase's PostgREST query builder cannot express `ST_DWithin` or `COUNT ... FILTER` directly, and no new migration/RPC was authorized this phase. The binding single-statement constraint (`TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` §5) is satisfied with ONE `.select('lat, lng, providers!inner(plan, status)')` round-trip against `provider_locations` (using its existing generated `lat`/`lng` columns from migration 036), filtered to `providers.status = 'active'` and GPS updated within 5 minutes — the 150km radius check and both count aggregations are then computed in application code via the existing `distanceMeters()` helper from `src/lib/geo.ts`. One query, no race window between two separate `SELECT`s. Runs via the admin (service-role) client — mandatory, not the user-context client, since a customer session cannot read other providers' rows under RLS. If the query fails, both snapshot columns are left `NULL` and the failure is logged as `snapshot_count_failed` — request creation still succeeds. This NULL fallback is INTENTIONAL (falls to the pre-tiered "visible to all" legacy path via migration 053's `COALESCE`) and must never be treated as a bug to fix.
- **`src/app/customer/request/page.tsx`:** GPS is now required to reach step 3 (the "Continue" button is disabled without `coords`, not `address`). `handleSubmit`'s validation now checks `coords` separately from `problemType`/`phone`, showing a dedicated `locationRequiredHint` message. The address field is fully decoupled from GPS: `handleAddressChange` no longer clears `coords` on edit (the superseded "manual-source bypass" — dead code removed, not reused), and a successful GPS fix no longer overwrites the address field with a placeholder string. The permission-denied handler no longer auto-focuses the address input (manual address can no longer substitute for GPS). A new `gpsAccuracy` state records `pos.coords.accuracy` (Q1: recorded, never gates). Step-3's summary falls back to a `gpsLocationConfirmed` message when the optional address note is empty.
- **i18n (`messages/en.json` + `messages/ar.json`):** modified `addressLabel`, `addressPlaceholder`, `locationNotSupported`, `locationDenied`, `locationFailed` to reflect GPS-mandatory / address-is-optional-note copy; added new keys `locationRequiredHint`, `gpsLocationConfirmed`. `manualLocation` is left in place, unused (harmless, not deleted).
- **Q2 (in-flight requests at deploy):** no special handling — a form opened pre-deploy and submitted post-deploy without coordinates gets the `coordinates_required` error with the existing retry path, which is the intended behavior.
- **`destination_emirate`:** left unpopulated — out of scope; the form has no destination-coordinate capture to derive it from (separate future form-phase item).

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- `npm run lint` — exit 0.

### Files changed
- `src/app/api/requests/route.ts`
- `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx`

- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — new "API phase (tiered dispatch activation)" status row, CODE COMPLETE — awaiting deploy
- `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` — §5 API-phase note marked IMPLEMENTED, records Q1/Q2, the dual-count implementation approach, the intentional NULL count-failure fallback, and the manual-source-bypass supersession
- `npm run lint` — exit 0.

### Files changed
- `supabase/migrations/053_tiered_visibility_rpc.sql` — created
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — migration baseline, Migration 053 row (CODE COMPLETE — NOT YET APPLIED), next migration number → 054
- `TIERED_DISPATCH_051_ANALYSIS.md` — §5 Phase 2 marked approved & written, Q-A/Q-B/Q-C resolutions and the binding UI constraint recorded
- `src/lib/env.ts` — NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL warning + Stripe price IDs in SERVER_REQUIRED_ENVS
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — plan reset on deletion + SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS import + monthlyJobAllowance fix

- `src/app/api/providers/documents/route.ts` — rate limiting (5/hour)
- `src/app/api/providers/plan/route.ts` — rate limiting (10/hour)
- `src/app/api/provider/jobs/complete/route.ts` — rate limiting (20/hour)

### Deferred issues (ongoing)
- Storage bucket `provider-documents` — 0 RLS policies
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — missing from Vercel env vars
- Phase 3 Finding 5 — PPJ distance always 0 on first checkout (under-charge bug)
- Phase 3 Finding 6 — Payment pages have no client_secret re-fetch fallback
- Phase 3 Finding 7 — No cron to clear stuck `processing` webhook events
- Phase 3 Finding 8 — Subscribe page uses RLS-gated client for plan read (consistency)
- Phase 1A deferred: login sequential role fetch, Navbar duplicated auth, router.refresh() 1200ms, prefetch all dashboards
- Phase 1A deferred: getViewerState() sequential queries, logout navigates to `/`
- `removeTracing: true` vs CWV capture — decision required
- `npm uninstall` 12 dead dependencies — safe to run any time

### New env vars required in Vercel (additions from this session)

## Session: June 5, 2026 — Phase 1B + 1C complete

### What was done

1. **Phase 1B Task 2** — `LAUNCH_PROMO` hardcoded `true` → `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO === 'true'`. Safe fallback: off if env var missing.

2. **Phase 1B Task 3** — PPJ fee constants (`PAY_PER_JOB_FEE_NEAR_AED`, `PAY_PER_JOB_FEE_FAR_AED`, `PAY_PER_JOB_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_M`, `PAY_PER_JOB_PROMO_FEE_AED`) moved to `NEXT_PUBLIC_PPJ_*` env vars. Safe numeric fallbacks to original hardcoded values.
   - File changed: `src/types/index.ts`

3. **Phase 1B Task 4 — Cron reliability (6 findings fixed):**
   - Finding 1: `vercel.json` created — `expire-requests` every 30 min, `monthly-allowance-reset` daily 00:00 UTC.
   - `ops-auth.ts` — added Vercel `CRON_SECRET` fallback so native cron injection works without manual secret alignment.
   - Both routes: added `GET` handler delegating to shared handler function (Vercel Cron calls GET).
   - Finding 3: `monthly-allowance-reset` serial UPDATE loop → `Promise.all` parallel updates.
   - Finding 4: `maxDuration = 30` on `expire-requests`, `maxDuration = 60` on `monthly-allowance-reset`.
   - Finding 5: `REQUEST_EXPIRY_HOURS` → `OPS_REQUEST_EXPIRY_HOURS` env var, fallback `2`.
   - Finding 6: `validateEnv()` — minimum 32-char length check on `OPS_CRON_SECRET`.

4. **Phase 1B Task 5 Finding 2 — Cancel double-compensation bug fixed:**
   - New RPC `cancel_request_and_compensate_atomic` (migration 019) — wraps cancel + provider compensation in one Postgres transaction with `FOR UPDATE` on request + provider rows. `cancellation_compensated_at IS NULL` guard is idempotency anchor.
   - `src/app/api/requests/cancel/route.ts` rewritten to call RPC. 230 lines → 176 lines.

5. **Phase 1B Task 5 Finding 1 — Release cleanup atomicity fixed:**
   - New RPC `release_job_atomic` (migration 020) — wraps request status update, jobs field reset, request_locks delete, and provider counter increment in one transaction. `provider_locations` delete remains post-RPC best-effort.
   - `src/app/api/provider/jobs/release/route.ts` rewritten to call RPC. 133 lines → 85 lines.

6. **Phase 1C — Deep RLS Hardening (migration 021):**
   - DROP `"Providers read locks"` on `request_locks` — all authenticated users could read all lock rows.
   - DROP `"Customers cancel own open request"` on `requests` — customers could UPDATE any column directly.
   - DROP `"Active providers read open requests"` on `requests` — bypassed migration 010 privacy masking.
   - DROP `"Customers read active providers"` on `providers` — exposed Stripe IDs + billing columns.
   - DROP `"Public read ratings"` + CREATE `"Authenticated read ratings"` — removed anon access.
   - DROP `"Active providers location visible"` on `provider_locations` — cross-provider location exposure.

7. **Phase 1C remaining (migration 022):**
   - REVOKE ALL on `reset_monthly_job_counters()` from all roles. COMMENT marking deprecated.
   - `ratings UNIQUE(job_id)` constraint confirmed via idempotent `DO $$` guard.

8. **Migration 020 duplication bug fixed** — file was doubled by file_write tool; duplicate block removed.

## Session: June 5, 2026 — Phase 1A Task 8 complete

### What was done

1. **Phase 1 marked complete.**
   - Sentry DSN + NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN confirmed on Vercel (May 31).
   - Sentry smoke verification confirmed done by user.
   - CLAUDE.md + DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md updated accordingly.

2. **Correction: Finding 1 (Task 1) was wrong.**
   - Original finding said "no middleware.ts" — token refresh missing.
   - In Next.js 16, middleware is renamed to `proxy.ts`. `src/proxy.ts` already exists and correctly implements Supabase token refresh via `supabase.auth.getUser()`.
   - Real issue found: proxy was doing a live DB role check on every protected request (every `/provider/*`, `/admin/*`, `/customer/*` navigation). Next.js auth docs explicitly warn against this.
   - **Fix applied:** Removed the `supabase.from('users').select('role')` call and all role-based redirect logic from `src/proxy.ts`. Proxy now only does token refresh + unauthenticated redirect. Role enforcement remains at page level + RLS.

3. **Phase 1A Task 1 — Auth/login performance audit (findings, no code changes except proxy fix).**

4. **Phase 1A Task 2 — Logout lag investigation (findings only).**
   - Fix applied: `signOut({ scope: 'local' })` in `Navbar.tsx` — eliminates 200–500ms server round-trip and Navbar flash on logout.

5. **Phase 1A Task 3 — Dashboard loading optimization audit (findings only, no fixes yet).**

---

### Phase 1A — Task 1 Correction: proxy.ts DB call removed

**File changed:** `src/proxy.ts`
- Removed: `PROVIDER_PREFIXES` constant
- Removed: `if (user && isProtected)` block — DB role check + 3 role-based redirect conditions
- Kept: token refresh (getUser), unauthenticated redirect, PROTECTED_PREFIXES, matcher
- Security: no gap — page-level checks and RLS still enforce role access

Remaining Task 1 findings (not yet fixed):

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Sequential role fetch after login (login/page.tsx:135) | Deferred |
| 3 | Navbar duplicates auth + role on every page | Deferred |
| 4 | router.refresh() + 1200ms fallback timer (login/page.tsx:57) | Deferred |
| 5 | Prefetches all 3 dashboards for every visitor | Deferred |
| 6 | getUser() on login mount for unauthed users | Deferred (low) |
| 7 | bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true in next.config.ts | Deferred (negligible) |

---

### Phase 1A — Task 2 Findings: Logout Lag

**Fix applied:** `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx:131`
- Changed `supabase.auth.signOut()` → `supabase.auth.signOut({ scope: 'local' })`
- Eliminates server round-trip to Supabase auth server (~200–500ms)
- SIGNED_OUT event fires instantly → no Navbar flash on landing page after logout
- Security trade-off: refresh token not invalidated server-side (acceptable — local-only logout)

Remaining logout findings (not fixed):

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | getViewerState() in home page runs 2–3 sequential DB queries during logout nav | Deferred — affects all home page visits, separate pass |
| 4 | Logout navigates to `/` (heaviest page) | Deferred |

---

### Phase 1A — Task 3 Findings: Dashboard Loading Optimization

#### Finding 1 — Admin dashboard: full table scans (HIGH) ✅ FIXED Jun 4
#### Finding 2 — Provider dashboard: sequential cascade (MEDIUM) ✅ FIXED Jun 4
#### Finding 3 — Customer request page: sequential API calls (MEDIUM) ✅ FIXED Jun 4
#### Finding 4 — Admin sequential role check (LOW) ✅ FIXED Jun 4

#### Finding 5 — Provider dashboard: fallback requests sequential after nearby RPC (LOW)
`src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx:378–403`
Fallback open requests query fires sequentially if nearby RPC returns empty.
Status: Deferred

#### Finding 6 — All loading.tsx skeletons incomplete (LOW)
None match actual page layout — causes layout shift on load.
Customer loading.tsx is unreachable at runtime (page is 'use client').
Status: Deferred

---

## Session: June 4, 2026

### What was done

1. **Phase 1A Finding 1 fix — Admin dashboard full table scans.**
2. **Phase 1A Finding 2 fix — Provider dashboard sequential cascade.**
3. **Phase 1A Finding 3 fix — Customer request sequential API calls.**
4. **Phase 1A Finding 4 fix — Admin sequential role check.**
5. **Phase 1A Task 4 — Supabase query profiling audit (findings only, no changes).**

---

### Phase 1A Finding 1 Fix: Admin dashboard full table scans

**File changed:** `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`

Replaced 2 unbounded selects with 7 targeted HEAD count queries inside the same `Promise.all`:
- `providers.select('status')` (fetched ALL rows) → 3 count queries: active / pending / suspended
- `requests.select('status')` (fetched ALL rows) → 3 count queries: open / completed / expired + 1 total count
- Removed 7 client-side `.filter().length` expressions (lines 43–50)
- All 7 new queries use `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` — zero rows transferred
- No JSX changes — variable names preserved via `?? 0` normalization

---

### Phase 1A Finding 2 Fix: Provider dashboard sequential cascade

**File changed:** `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`

Parallelized `recentCustomerCancellation` and `recentPpjPayment` — both gated on `!activeRequest` only, no dependency on each other:
- Before: 4 sequential awaits after Promise.all(3): activeCustomer → cancellation → ppjPayment → overagePayment
- After: activeCustomer sequential (true dependency — needs customer_id), then `Promise.all([cancellation, ppjPayment])` in parallel
- `recentOveragePayment` stays sequential (depends on `!recentPpjPayment`)
- Saves 1 roundtrip in normal loads (no active job) and 1 more in payment-return flow
- All logger.warn calls preserved

---

### Phase 1A Finding 3 Fix: Customer request sequential API calls

**Files changed:** `src/app/api/requests/route.ts`, `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx`

Merged unrated-jobs count into `/api/requests` response — eliminates the sequential second fetch:
- In `route.ts`: split `unratedJob` derivation into `unratedJobs` array, added `unratedJobsCount`, included `unrated_jobs_count` in both response branches (no extra DB query — computed from existing `completedJobs` + `ratedJobIds` data already in memory)
- In `page.tsx`: added `unrated_jobs_count` to `ActiveRequestResponse` type; added `setUnratedJobsCount` call inside `loadRequestState`; removed `loadUnratedJobsCount` function + its `useEffect`
- Every 12-second poll now also refreshes the unrated count from server

---

### Phase 1A Finding 4 Fix: Admin sequential role check

**File changed:** `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`

Merged role query into the main `Promise.all` — fires in parallel with all 14 data queries:
- Before: `getUser()` → role check → Promise.all(14 queries) — 3 sequential phases
- After: `getUser()` → Promise.all(role query + 14 data queries) → validate role — 2 sequential phases
- Saves ~50–100ms on every admin dashboard load
- Role redirect moved to after Promise.all — fires before any data is rendered
- Security: unchanged — RLS protects data independently; redirect fires before rendering

---

### Phase 1A Task 4: Supabase Query Profiling — Findings

#### Finding 1 — Missing `users.role` index (HIGH)
- Admin dashboard fires 2 HEAD count queries on `users` filtered by `role` on every load — full table scan without index
- `is_admin()` RLS function also uses `role` but filters by `id` PK first — less critical
- **Proposed fix (migration 016):** `CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users(role);`

#### Finding 2 — Missing `overage_payments` indexes (MEDIUM)
- Admin dashboard: `overage_payments.eq('status', 'failed')` count — full scan, no `status` index
- Provider dashboard: `overage_payments.eq('provider_id', ...).in('status', [...]).order('created_at')` — no composite index
- Migration 013 only covered `overage_payments_stripe_intent` (webhook lookup)
- **Proposed fix (migration 016):**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_overage_payments_provider_status_created
    ON overage_payments (provider_id, status, created_at DESC);
  CREATE INDEX idx_overage_payments_status
    ON overage_payments (status);
  ```

#### Finding 3 — Missing `payout_log.created_at` index (MEDIUM)
- Admin dashboard: `payout_log.order('created_at', DESC).limit(5)` — full scan, no `created_at` index
- **Proposed fix (migration 016):** `CREATE INDEX idx_payout_log_created ON payout_log(created_at DESC);`

#### Finding 4 — Missing `ratings(provider_id, created_at DESC)` index (MEDIUM)
- `update_provider_rating()` DB trigger fires on every rating INSERT
- Trigger query: `SELECT stars FROM ratings WHERE provider_id = NEW.provider_id ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50`
- No composite index — sequential scan that grows with provider rating count
- **Proposed fix (migration 016):** `CREATE INDEX idx_ratings_provider_created ON ratings(provider_id, created_at DESC);`

#### Finding 5 — Location route: 2 sequential PK lookups (LOW)
- `src/app/api/provider/location/route.ts` — called every ~30–60s by all online providers
- `users.select('role').eq('id', ...)` → `providers.select('id, status').eq('id', ...)` — sequential PK lookups
- Both only need `user.id`; parallelizable with `Promise.all`
- **Proposed fix:** Code change — `Promise.all`

#### Finding 6 — Accept route: 4 sequential checks before atomic RPC (LOW)
- `src/app/api/provider/requests/accept/route.ts`
- 4 sequential checks (users role, provider status, provider_locations, active job) all need only `user.id`
- All 4 can be parallelized before the RPC
- **Proposed fix:** Code change — `Promise.all`

---

### Phase 1A Task 4 Code Fixes: Location + Accept Route

**Files changed:**
- `src/app/api/provider/location/route.ts` — Finding 5: 2 sequential PK lookups → `Promise.all([users.role, providers.status])`. Saves 1 round-trip per location ping.
- `src/app/api/provider/requests/accept/route.ts` — Finding 6: 4 sequential checks → `Promise.all([users.role, providers, provider_locations, active job])`. `admin` client + `onlineSince` moved above the await. Guard order preserved: role → 404 → status → offline → active job. Saves 3 round-trips per accept attempt.

**Note from audit:** location route is button-triggered only (not auto-polled). `MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS = 2min`, `MIN_MOVEMENT_METERS = 250m` throttle on client side. The "30–60s" estimate in the Task 4 report was wrong — parallelization still correct.

---

### Migration 016 Applied

- `supabase/migrations/016_task4_query_indexes.sql` created and applied in Supabase SQL Editor.
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` updated: migration 016 ✅, Tasks 1–4 marked complete, date updated to June 4.
- 5 indexes applied: `idx_users_role`, `idx_overage_payments_provider_status_created`, `idx_overage_payments_status`, `idx_payout_log_created`, `idx_ratings_provider_created`.

---

### Phase 1A Task 5: Polling Reduction Audit + Fix

**Audit finding:** Only ONE active polling loop in the entire app — customer request page 12s `setInterval`. Location updates are manual/button-triggered only. No other background polling.

**Fix applied:** `src/app/customer/request/page.tsx:162`
- Added `const pollMs = activeRequest.status === 'open' ? 20000 : 12000`
- `open` status: 20s (waiting for any provider — infrequent state changes)
- `accepted` / `in_progress`: 12s (provider en route — more time-sensitive)
- `visibilitychange` + `online` listeners (lines 171–187) already handle immediate refresh on tab return — makes longer background interval safe
- Saves ~40% polls/hour for requests in `open` state

---

### Phase 1A Task 6: Core Web Vitals Baseline Audit

**6 findings:**

| # | Finding | Metric | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sentry client config missing — no production CWV data | All | HIGH |
| 2 | Navbar CLS: skeleton→content shift on every page | CLS | HIGH |
| 3 | Home page LCP blocked by sequential getViewerState() | LCP/TTFB | MEDIUM |
| 4 | customer/request/loading.tsx unreachable (page is 'use client') | FCP | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Provider dashboard skeleton: rough match only | CLS | LOW |
| 6 | No preconnect for client-side Supabase auth calls | LCP/Navbar | LOW |

**Finding 2 note:** Navbar is 'use client'. Server renders skeleton (`loading: true`), then client-side auth resolves (`getUser()` + `users.select('role')`), causing CLS on every page. Requires architectural change — defer to Phase 2B.

**Finding 3 note:** `getViewerState()` in `src/app/page.tsx:150–204` has 3 sequential DB queries for provider users. Blocks entire home page HTML stream. Deferred — Task 2 carry-over.

**Fix applied (Finding 6):** `src/app/layout.tsx`
```tsx
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL && (
  <link rel="preconnect" href={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL} crossOrigin="anonymous" />
)}
```
`crossOrigin="anonymous"` required — Supabase browser calls use `Authorization: Bearer` headers (CORS, not cookies). Without it, browser won't reuse the preconnected socket for CORS fetch pool.

---

### Phase 1A Task 6 — Finding 1: sentry.client.config.ts ✅ DONE Jun 4 (session 2)

**File created:** `sentry.client.config.ts` (project root)

Matches `sentry.server.config.ts` exactly except:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` instead of `SENTRY_DSN` (only public env var is accessible in browser bundle)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` instead of `VERCEL_ENV` (same reason — public system var Vercel auto-sets to "production"/"preview"/"development")
- No `profilesSampleRate` line (client-side Sentry SDK doesn't support profiling)

Privacy rules preserved:
- `sendDefaultPii: false`
- `scrubSentryErrorEvent` + `scrubSentryTransactionEvent` hooks — same pipeline as server/edge
- No replay (webpack config already excludes all replay modules)
- `tracesSampleRate: 0` — matches server

**Important finding — CWV capture deferred:**
`next.config.ts:108` has `removeTracing: true` in the Sentry webpack config. This tree-shakes all tracing code from the bundle, making `browserTracingIntegration` (needed for INP/LCP/CLS) a no-op at build time. CWV capture via Sentry requires removing that flag — flagged as a follow-up for Task 7 or a dedicated CWV pass.

---

## Session: June 4, 2026 (session 3)

### What was done
1. **CLAUDE.md updated** — Task 6 Finding 1 marked complete, Task 7 audit findings added, "الجاي" pointer advanced to Task 8.
2. **Phase 1A Task 7 — Bundle size audit** (findings only, no code changes).
3. **Phase 1A Task 7 — Full deep audit completed** — see findings below (session 3 continuation).

---

### Phase 1A Task 7: Bundle Size Audit — Findings (full, session 3)

Audit scope: `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, all `src/` imports, all UI components, all lib modules.

#### Finding 1 — 11 completely dead dependencies (HIGH)
All 9 `@radix-ui/*` packages + `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers` are in `package.json` but have ZERO imports anywhere in `src/`. All UI components (`Button`, `Select`, `Input`, `Accordion`, `Badge`, `Card`) are custom native-HTML + Tailwind — the Radix/RHF stack was installed (likely from shadcn/ui scaffolding) but never wired up.
- Production bundle impact: **zero** (never imported → webpack excludes)
- `node_modules` bloat: ~15+ packages with sub-dependencies, slower installs, `npm audit` noise
- **Proposed fix (terminal):**
  ```
  npm uninstall @radix-ui/react-avatar @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-separator @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-toast react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers
  ```

#### Finding 2 — `date-fns` unused (LOW)
`"date-fns": "^4.2.1"` in `package.json`, zero imports anywhere. Production bundle impact: zero.
- **Proposed fix (terminal):** `npm uninstall date-fns`

#### Finding 3 — `removeTracing: true` blocks CWV capture (MEDIUM, carry-over from Task 6)
`next.config.ts:108` — Sentry webpack plugin tree-shakes all tracing code out of the bundle.
`browserTracingIntegration()` (needed for INP/LCP/CLS via Sentry) is a no-op after build.
- Bundle benefit: tracing code removed from client JS
- CWV cost: no INP/LCP/CLS data in Sentry production dashboard
- **Decision required:** keep `removeTracing: true` (errors-only Sentry, smaller bundle) OR remove it + add `browserTracingIntegration` + `tracesSampleRate: 0.05` to `sentry.client.config.ts`
- Deferred — requires user choice.

#### Finding 4 — `zod` and `stripe` Node SDK correctly isolated (CONFIRMED GOOD)
`zod` — API routes only. `stripe` Node SDK (`src/lib/stripe.ts`) — API routes only. No client bundle exposure.

#### Finding 5 — No `server-only` guards on server libs (LOW — future risk)
`src/lib/stripe.ts`, `src/lib/logger.ts`, `src/lib/env.ts`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`, `src/lib/ops-auth.ts` — none have `import 'server-only'`.
- Current risk: low (all currently imported server-side only).
- Future risk: accidental 'use client' import would silently pull Node.js Stripe SDK into client bundle.
- Deferred to Phase 1C hardening pass.

#### Finding 6 — `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS` duplicated in 3 places (LOW — maintenance risk)
- `src/types/index.ts` — canonical source with Stripe price IDs
- `src/app/provider/register/page.tsx:15` — local `PLANS` array, hardcoded prices, no Stripe IDs
- `src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout/route.ts:16` — local string array `['starter', 'pro', 'business']`
- No bundle impact. Risk: plan additions/renames won't propagate to all 3 locations. Deferred.

#### Finding 7 — `LAUNCH_PROMO = true` requires redeploy to toggle (LOW — operational)
`src/types/index.ts:55`. Should eventually be a `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO` env var. Deferred.

#### Confirmed good (no action needed)
- `lucide-react` — named imports on all 24 import sites, tree-shaking correct
- `@stripe/react-stripe-js` / `@stripe/stripe-js` — client-only, payment pages only
- `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` — used in `utils.ts`, correctly shared
- `geo.ts`, `utils.ts` — pure functions, safe in client components
- `logger.ts` — server components + API routes only, zero client exposure
- `Navbar.tsx` — 'use client', Supabase client auth only, no heavy leaks
- `@supabase/ssr` — shared client boundary via Navbar, expected

#### Action order
1. `npm uninstall` the 11 dead deps — safe, immediate (Finding 1)
2. `npm uninstall date-fns` — safe, immediate (Finding 2)
3. Decide `removeTracing` / CWV tradeoff (Finding 3) — user decision
4. `server-only` guards — Phase 1C pass (Finding 5)
5. `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS` deduplication — any future cleanup pass
6. `LAUNCH_PROMO` → env var — before promo ends

---

### Next Task: Phase 1A Task 8 — Production Slow-Query Identification

Goal: identify which DB queries are slow in production using `pg_stat_statements` or Supabase dashboard.
Scope: review current query patterns in API routes + server pages against the indexes applied in migrations 013 + 016.

---

---

## Session: June 4, 2026 (session 4 — end of day wrap-up)

### What was done
1. **SESSION_LOG.md + CLAUDE.md** — end-of-session update: CLAUDE.md المراحل القادمة corrected (tasks 1–7 all done, Task 8 only remaining).
2. No new code changes this session — Tasks 6 and 7 were the work; this entry closes the day.

### Next Task: Phase 1A Task 8 — Production Slow-Query Identification
Goal: identify which queries are slow in production using Supabase dashboard or `pg_stat_statements`.
Scope: review all API routes + server pages against indexes from migrations 013 + 016.
No code changes expected — audit + findings only.

Pending user decisions before Task 8:
- `removeTracing: true` vs CWV capture — keep or remove?
- Run `npm uninstall` for 12 dead dependencies? (safe, no code impact)

---

## Session: June 5, 2026 — VERDENT_HANDOFF.md created

### What was done
1. **VERDENT_HANDOFF.md** — created (project root). Complete 15-section handoff document for another AI or engineer. Covers: business model, architecture, all phases, business logic, schema, env vars, API routes, known issues, technical decisions, constraints, deployment, testing, next steps.
2. **README.md** — updated to reflect current project status and link to all documentation files.
3. **`src/proxy.ts`** — inline comments added explaining middleware role, why no DB role check, cookie dance requirement.
4. **`src/app/api/provider/requests/accept/route.ts`** — inline comments added explaining rate limit, parallelized pre-flight checks, overage guard logic, pre-flight lock check advisory nature, atomic RPC purpose.
5. **`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`** — inline comments added explaining force-dynamic, idempotency claim pattern, PROCESSING_TIMEOUT_MS, PLAN_BY_PRICE_ID, payment intent handler, subscription sync, raw body requirement.

## Session: June 5, 2026 (session 3 — VERDENT_HANDOFF.md expanded to 25 sections)

### What was done
1. **VERDENT_HANDOFF.md** — expanded with 6 new sections (20–25). Full codebase audit performed: read all 16 migrations, webhook route, accept route, complete route, release route, proxy.ts. Three factual corrections documented. No duplicate content added.
   - **Section 20**: Complete DB column reference — all 12 tables, all columns from all 16 migrations, full index inventory.
   - **Section 21**: Dedicated Authentication Flow — registration, login, session handling, role management, logout, admin creation.
   - **Section 22**: Current Production State — Vercel/Supabase/Stripe/Sentry/Cron/Storage snapshot + launch readiness checklist (~35%).
   - **Section 23**: Corrections and Clarifications — 3 factual errors corrected from source code audit.
   - **Section 24**: Ready-to-use Prompt for Next AI — self-contained copy-paste prompt covering all critical rules.
   - **Section 25**: Final Validation — document stats, files reviewed, files not reviewed, assumptions, missing resources.

### Corrections discovered (from codebase audit)
1. `complete_provider_job_atomic` does NOT delete provider_locations. Only the release route deletes it. Section 16 had a wrong step 4.
2. PPJ recovery credit is ONLY for customer-cancelled requests. NOT restored when another provider accepts the request during payment. Sections 6 and 16 both had wrong descriptions.
3. `checkout.session.completed` is log-only — no DB writes. Provider activation is via `customer.subscription.created`. Section 16 had wrong handler name and wrong action.

### Files changed
- `VERDENT_HANDOFF.md` — sections 20–25 added
- `SESSION_LOG.md` — this update

### Next Task: Phase 1A Task 8 — Production Slow-Query Identification
Goal: identify slow queries in production using Supabase `pg_stat_statements` dashboard.
Scope: review all API routes + server pages against indexes from migrations 013 + 016. Audit-only, no code changes expected.

Pending before Task 8:
- `npm run lint && npm run build` — user runs from terminal
- `git add . && git commit -m "Phase 1A complete + VERDENT_HANDOFF.md expanded (sections 20–25)" && git push`
- Decision: `removeTracing: true` vs CWV capture (can defer)
- Optional: `npm uninstall` for 12 dead dependencies (safe, no code impact)

## Session: June 5, 2026 — Phase 1A Task 8 complete

### What was done

1. **Issue #1 verified** — `getOpsCronSecret` confirmed exported in `src/lib/env.ts:30`. False alarm from truncated read.

2. **Phase 1A Task 8 — Production slow-query identification (audit + fixes).**
   Full cross-reference of all 20 API routes + 8 server pages against all 25 indexes in migrations 013 + 016. 12 findings produced.

3. **Findings 1, 2, 5 — code fixes (no migration).**
   - `src/app/admin/revenue/page.tsx:70` — `payout_log`: narrowed `select('*')` to 6 used columns + added `.limit(100)`. `idx_payout_log_created` now does useful bounded work.
   - `src/app/admin/revenue/page.tsx:71` — `jobs`: narrowed `select('*')` to 4 used columns + added `.not('completed_at', 'is', null)`. `idx_jobs_completed` partial index now eligible.
   - `src/app/admin/providers/page.tsx:112` — `providers`: narrowed `select('*')` to 8 columns in `AdminProviderRow` + added `.limit(200)`. Removes billing columns from wire transfer, caps unbounded fetch.

4. **Findings 3, 4, 6 — migration 017 applied.**
   - `idx_ppj_payments_status_created` — covers admin-wide `ppj_payments` status filter + sort.
   - `idx_overage_payments_status_created` — covers admin-wide `overage_payments` status filter + sort.
   - `idx_requests_created` — covers admin/requests unfiltered `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100`.
   - `supabase/migrations/017_task8_query_indexes.sql` created.

5. **Finding 10 — `get_nearby_open_requests` RPC audited + migration 018 applied.**
   - Function confirmed present in production but absent from all prior migrations.
   - Index coverage confirmed: GIST spatial index + partial index on open/unassigned requests + PK lookups — all correct.
   - No query logic changes. Migration 018 is tracking-only — captures production function body into version control.
   - `supabase/migrations/018_capture_get_nearby_open_requests.sql` created.

### Files changed
- `src/app/admin/revenue/page.tsx` — Findings 1 + 2 (payout_log limit, jobs narrow + null filter)
- `src/app/admin/providers/page.tsx` — Finding 5 (providers narrow + limit)
- `supabase/migrations/017_task8_query_indexes.sql` — created (3 indexes, applied in Supabase)
- `supabase/migrations/018_capture_get_nearby_open_requests.sql` — created (RPC capture, applied in Supabase)
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` — migrations 017 + 018 marked ✅, Task 8 marked complete
- `SESSION_LOG.md` — this update

### Task 8 findings not yet actioned (deferred)
- Finding 7 — `monthly-allowance-reset` serial UPDATE loop → `Promise.all` or bulk UPDATE. Deferred to Phase 1B cron reliability pass.
- Finding 8 — `complete/route.ts` 2 sequential reads before RPC → `Promise.all`. Low priority.
- Finding 9 — `release/route.ts` sequential role+counters reads → `Promise.all`. Low priority.
- Finding 10 — `get_nearby_open_requests` CROSS JOIN silent empty result when provider offline. Design decision — deferred.
- Finding 12 — Sequential `users.role` check in admin pages/routes → merge into `Promise.all`. Low priority.

### Phase 1A — now fully complete ✅
All 8 tasks done. Migrations 001–018 applied.

### Next task: Phase 1B remaining
- Cron reliability + monitoring (monthly-allowance-reset serial loop — Finding 7 above)
- `LAUNCH_PROMO` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO` env var
- PPJ fees → configurable server-side
- Additional DB indexes as identified

### Deferred issues (ongoing)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — missing from Vercel env vars
- Storage bucket `provider-documents` — 0 RLS policies (review SETUP.md §4)
- CSP violations review — report-only has been running since Phase 1
- Stripe still on test/sandbox keys — live keys before real launch (Phase 10)
- Phase 1A Task 1 deferred: login sequential role fetch, Navbar duplicated auth, router.refresh() + 1200ms fallback, prefetch all 3 dashboards
- Phase 1A Task 2 deferred: getViewerState() sequential queries on home page, logout navigates to `/`
- Phase 1A Task 3 deferred: Finding 5 (provider fallback sequential), Finding 6 (skeleton completeness)
- Phase 1A Task 7: `removeTracing: true` vs CWV — decision required before enabling `browserTracingIntegration`
- Phase 1A Task 7: add `server-only` guards to `stripe.ts`, `logger.ts`, `env.ts`, `notifications.ts`, `rate-limit.ts`, `ops-auth.ts` — Phase 1C
- Phase 1A Task 7: `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS` defined in 3 places — dedup in cleanup pass
- Phase 1A Task 7: `LAUNCH_PROMO = true` hardcoded — move to `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_PROMO` env var before promo ends
- `npm uninstall @radix-ui/react-avatar @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-separator @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-toast react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers date-fns` — safe to run any time

## Session: July 16, 2026 — Migration 057 (Phase 3 Step 3, Items C+D) implemented

**Precondition verified before writing code (per the 046/048/053/055 lesson):** `submit_quote_atomic`'s live body was already confirmed (prior session) to match migration 055 exactly. `select_quote_atomic`'s live definition was retrieved by Medo and diffed in full against migration 048 as the first implementation step of this session — no drift found. Live grants for both functions confirmed as of July 16, 2026: `PUBLIC=false, anon=false, authenticated=false, service_role=true` for both.

**Implemented (code complete, NOT yet applied to Supabase):**
- `supabase/migrations/057_phase3_step3_credit_consumption_ssot.sql` — `select_quote_atomic`: replaced the hardcoded 15/35/unlimited plan-limit CASE with `get_provider_limits()` (SSOT), added the approved 4-case credit-consumption gate (under limit → allow; at/over limit + `overage_cleared=FALSE` + credit available → consume exactly one credit via column-relative `UPDATE` under the existing provider-row `FOR UPDATE` lock, then proceed; at/over limit + `overage_cleared=TRUE` → allow, no credit consumed; at/over limit + no credit → unchanged `overage_required` result). `jobs_this_month` still increments unconditionally on every successful subscriber selection. `submit_quote_atomic`: SSOT wiring only (Step 4's two hardcoded CASE blocks replaced by one `get_provider_limits()` call) — no other change, contract fully preserved. Both functions kept via `CREATE OR REPLACE` (signatures unchanged, no DROP) with grants explicitly restated (`REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC/anon/authenticated`, `GRANT EXECUTE TO service_role`), not relying on migration 056's default privileges. A verify-first `DO` block aborts the migration if `get_provider_limits`, `providers.job_credit_balance`, `requests.overage_cleared`, `select_quote_atomic`, or `submit_quote_atomic` are missing.
- `src/lib/provider-allowance.ts` — fixed the double-counting bug: `effectiveLimit` (previously `planLimit + creditBalance`) is dropped entirely (verified misleading once a request is funded by paid overage — `jobsThisMonth` can exceed `planLimit` with zero credits left, which would derive `effectiveLimit = jobsThisMonth` and hide the real plan limit). New formula: `remaining = max(0, planLimit - jobsThisMonth) + creditBalance` — base allowance and credit balance are two separate, non-overlapping buckets.
- `src/app/provider/plan/page.tsx` — `usagePct` now derived from `jobsThisMonth / planLimit` (capped at 100%, never shrinks as credits are consumed); `ofLimit` now renders `planLimit` instead of the removed `effectiveLimit`. `src/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx` needed no change (only consumes `creditBalance`, not `effectiveLimit`).
- `src/app/api/provider/overage-checkout/route.ts` — gate corrected to `!allowance.hasMonthlyAllowance` / `(allowance.remaining ?? 0) > 0` (same semantic as the RPC gate, even though this route's UI trigger is currently unreachable dead code — see P20).
- `src/app/api/provider/jobs/quote/route.ts` — added `jobs_this_month`/`job_credit_balance` to the already-fetched provider row and `overage_cleared` to the already-fetched request row (no extra query). After a successful `submit_quote_atomic` call, an additive `warning_code: 'monthly_allowance_exhausted'` is included in the response only when the plan has a finite monthly limit (explicit `plan === 'starter' || plan === 'pro'` check), corrected `remaining === 0`, and the request's `overage_cleared !== true`. Wrapped in try/catch — a lookup failure logs via the existing logger and falls back to the plain success response, never an error.
- `src/components/provider/ProviderQuoteForm.tsx` — renders the translated warning notice below the success confirmation when `warning_code` is present; absence of the field means no warning (old/new client and route combinations stay compatible).
- `src/app/api/customer/quote/select/route.ts` — added the missing `overage_required` → HTTP 409 mapping (previously fell through to a generic 500).
- `src/components/customer/CustomerQuoteList.tsx` — added `unavailableQuoteIds` client state; on `overage_required`, the quote id is added to the set, the translated message is shown, and the quotes list is refetched. Rendering now filters on `unavailableQuoteIds` (Option A leaves the quote row pending in the DB, so the quotes API keeps returning it on refetch — the client-side filter persists for the mounted view's lifetime).
- `messages/ar.json` and `messages/en.json` — added `providerRequestList.monthlyAllowanceExhausted` and `customerQuoteList.providerNoLongerAvailable` (Arabic added first, per convention).
- Submission-time blocking on exhaustion was investigated and explicitly NOT implemented — the pre-submission overage path is dead code in the live V2 UI (LB-6). Recorded as `DEFERRED_PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` P19 (overage-economics redesign) and P20 (legacy overage UI audit/retirement, not removed in this session).

**Local verification this session:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and JSON-parse validation of both message files — results recorded in the same commit-adjacent verification pass (see PR/diff notes). **Production application is PENDING** — migration 057 has not been run against Supabase. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` updated accordingly (Migration 057 row, LB-12 section) with an honest CODE COMPLETE / NOT APPLIED status; no runtime verification is claimed.

**Next task:** Medo applies migration 057, re-runs `pg_get_functiondef` for both functions and the grants query to confirm the live state matches this migration exactly, then works through the behavioral verification checklist (base limit, credit consumption, final-credit warning, Business no-warning, customer `overage_required` UX, overage_cleared bypass, concurrent final-credit selection) before Step 3 is marked done in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
